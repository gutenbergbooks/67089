<p>I cannot remember the time when I was not
absolutely certain that I would be a millionaire.
And I had not been a week in the big
wholesale dry-goods house in Worth Street
in which I made my New York start, before
I looked round and said to myself: &#8220;I shall
be sole proprietor here some day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Probably clerks dream the same thing every
day in every establishment on earth&mdash;but I
didn&#8217;t dream; I <i>knew</i>. From earliest boyhood
I had seen that the millionaire was the
only citizen universally envied, honoured, and
looked up to. I wanted to be in the first class,
and I knew I had only to stick to my ambition
and to think of nothing else and to let nothing
stand in the way of it. There are so few men
capable of forming a definite, serious purpose,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
and of persisting in it, that those who
are find the road almost empty before they
have gone far.</p>

<p>By the time I was thirty-three years old I
had arrived at the place where the crowd is
pretty well thinned out. I was what is called
a successful man. I was general manager of
the dry-goods house at ten thousand a year&mdash;a
huge salary for those days. I had nearly
sixty thousand dollars put by in gilt-edged
securities. I had built a valuable reputation
for knowing my business and keeping my
word. I owned a twenty-five-foot brownstone
house in a side street not far from Madison
Avenue, and in it I had a comfortable,
happy, old-fashioned home. At thirty-two I
had gone back to my native town to marry a
girl there, one of those women who have ambition
beyond gadding all the time and spending
every cent their husbands earn, and who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
know how to make home attractive to husband
and children.</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t exaggerate the value of my family,
especially my wife, to me in those early
days. True, I should have gone just as far
without them, but they made my life cheerful
and comfortable; and, now that sentiment of
that narrow kind is all in the past, it&#8217;s most
agreeable occasionally to look back on those
days and sentimentalise a little.</p>

<p>That I worked intelligently, as well as hard,
is shown by the fact that I was made junior
partner at thirty-eight. My partner&mdash;there
were only two of us&mdash;was then an elderly man
and the head of the old and prominent New
York family of Judson&mdash;that is not the real
name, of course. Ours was the typical old-fashioned
firm, doing business on principles of
politeness rather than of strict business. One
of its iron-clad customs was that the senior<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
partner should retire at sixty. Mr. Judson&#8217;s
intention was to retire in about five years, I
to become the head of the firm, though with
the smaller interest, and one of his grandsons
to become the larger partner, though
with the lesser control&mdash;at least, for a term of
years.</p>

<p>It was called evidence of great friendship
and confidence that Mr. Judson thus &#8220;favoured&#8221;
me. Probably this notion would have
been stronger had it been known on what
moderate terms and at what an easy price he
let me have the fourth interest. No doubt Mr.
Judson himself thought he was most generous.
But I knew better. There was no sentimentality
about my ideas of business, and my experience
has been that there isn&#8217;t about any
one&#8217;s when you cut through surface courtesy
and cant and get down to the real facts. I
knew I had earned every step of my promotion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
from a clerk; and, while Mr. Judson
might have selected some one else as a partner,
he wouldn&#8217;t have done so, because he needed
me. I had seen to that in my sixteen years
of service there.</p>

<p>Judson wasn&#8217;t a self-made man, as I was.
He had inherited his share in the business, and
a considerable fortune, besides. The reason
he was so anxious to have me as a partner was
that for six years I had carried all his business
cares, even his private affairs. Yes, he needed
me&mdash;though, no doubt, in a sense, he was my
friend. Who wouldn&#8217;t have been my friend
under the circumstances? But, having looked
out for his own interest and comfort in selecting
me, why should he have expected that I
wouldn&#8217;t look out for mine? The only kind
of loyalty a man who wishes to do something
in the world should give or expect is the mutual
loyalty of common interest.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>I confess I never liked Judson. To be
quite frank, from the first day I came into
that house, I envied him. I used to think it
was contempt; but, since my own position has
changed, I know it was envy. I remember
that the first time I saw him I noted his handsome,
carefully dressed figure, so out of place
among the sweat and shirt sleeves and the litter
of goods and packing cases, and I asked
one of my fellow-clerks: &#8220;Who&#8217;s that fop?&#8221;
When he told me it was the son of the proprietor,
and my prospective chief boss, I said
to myself: &#8220;It won&#8217;t be hard to get <i>you</i> out
of the way;&#8221; for I had brought from the country
the prejudice that fine clothes and fine
manners proclaim the noddle-pate.</p>

<p>I envied my friend&mdash;for, in a master-and-servant
way, that was highly, though, of
course, secretly distasteful to me, we became
friends. I envied him his education, his inherited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
wealth, his manners, his aristocratic
appearance, and, finally, his social position. It
seemed to me that none of these things that
he had and I hadn&#8217;t belonged of right to him,
because he hadn&#8217;t earned them. It seemed to
me that his having them was an outrageous
injustice to me.</p>

<p>I think I must have hated him. Yes, I did
hate him. How is it possible for a man who
feels that he is born to rule not to hate those
whom blind fate has put as obstacles in his
way? To get what you want in this world
you must be a good hater. The best haters
make the best grabbers, and this is a world of
grab, not of &#8220;By your leave,&#8221; or &#8220;If you&#8217;ll
permit me, sir.&#8221; You can&#8217;t get what you
want away from the man who&#8217;s got it unless
you hate him. Gentle feelings paralyse the
conquering arm.</p>

<p>So, at thirty-eight, it seemed to be settled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
that I was to be a respectable Worth Street
merchant, in active life until I should be sixty,
always under the shadow of the great Judson
family, and thereafter a respectable retired
merchant and substantial citizen with five hundred
thousand dollars or thereabouts. But it
never entered my head to submit to that sort
of decree of destiny, dooming me to respectable
obscurity. Nature intended me for
larger things.</p>

<p>The key to my true destiny, as I had seen
for several years, was the possession of a large
sum of money&mdash;a million dollars. Without it,
I must work on at my past intolerably slow
pace. With it, I could leap at once into my
kingdom. But, how get it? In the regular
course of any business conducted on proper
lines, such a sum, even to-day, rewards the
successful man starting from nothing only
when the vigour of youth is gone and the habits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
of conservatism and routine are fixed. I
knew I must get my million not in driblets,
not after years of toil, but at once, in a lump
sum. I must get it even at some temporary
sacrifice of principle, if necessary.</p>

<p>If I had not seen the opportunity to get it
through Judson and Company, I should have
retired from that house years before I got the
partnership. But I did see it there, saw it
coming even before I was general manager,
saw it the first time I got a peep into the private
affairs of Mr. Judson.</p>

<p>Judson and Company, like all old-established
houses, was honeycombed with carelessness
and wastefulness. To begin with, it
treated its employees on a basis of mixed
business and benevolence, and that is always
bad unless the benevolence is merely an ingenious
pretext for getting out of your people
work that you don&#8217;t pay for. But Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
Judson, having a good deal of the highfaluting
<i>grand seigneur</i> about him, made the benevolence
genuine. Then, the theory was that
the Judsons were born merchants, and knew
all there was to be known, and did not need to
attend to business. Mr. Judson, being firmly
convinced of his greatness, and being much
engaged socially and in posing as a great
merchant at luncheons and receptions to distinguished
strangers and the like, put me in
full control as soon as he made me general
manager. He interfered in the business only
occasionally, and then merely to show how
large and generous he was&mdash;to raise salaries,
to extend unwise credits, to bolster up decaying
mills that had long sold goods to the house,
to indorse for his friends. Friends! Who
that can and will lend and indorse has not
hosts of friends? What I have waited to see
before selecting my friends is the friendship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
that survives the death of its hope of favours&mdash;and
I&#8217;m still waiting.</p>

<p>As soon as I became partner I confirmed
in detail the suspicion, or, rather, the instinctive
knowledge, which had kept me from looking
elsewhere for my opportunity.</p>

<p>I recall distinctly the day my crisis came.
It had two principal events.</p>

<p>The first was my discovery that Mr. Judson
had got the firm and himself so entangled that
he was in my power. I confess my impulse
was to take a course which a weaker or less
courageous man would have taken&mdash;away
from the course of the strong man with the
higher ambition and the broader view of life
and morals. And it was while I seemed to be
wavering&mdash;I say &#8220;seemed to be&#8221; because I do
not think a strong, far-sighted man of resolute
purpose is ever &#8220;squeamish,&#8221; as they call
it&mdash;while, I say, I was in the mood of uncertainty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
which often precedes energetic action,
we, my wife and I, went to dinner at the
Judsons.</p>

<p>That dinner was the second event of my
crucial day. Judson&#8217;s family and mine did
not move in the same social circle. When
people asked my wife if she knew Mrs. Judson&mdash;which
they often maliciously did&mdash;she
always answered: &#8220;Oh, no&mdash;my husband keeps
our home life and his business distinct; and,
you know, New York is very large. The Judsons
and we haven&#8217;t the same friends.&#8221; That
was her way of hiding our rankling wound&mdash;for
it rankled with me as much as with her;
in those days we had everything in common,
like the humble people that we were.</p>

<p>I can see now her expression of elation as
she displayed the note of invitation from Mrs.
Judson: &#8220;It would give us great pleasure if
you and your husband would dine with us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
quite informally,&#8221; etc. Her face clouded as
she repeated, &#8220;quite informally.&#8221; &#8220;They
wouldn&#8217;t for worlds have any of their fashionable
friends there to meet <span class="allsmcap">US</span>.&#8221; Even then
she was far away from the time when, to my
saying, &#8220;You shall have your victoria and
drive in the park and get your name in the
papers like Mrs. Judson,&#8221; she laughed and
answered&mdash;honestly, I know&mdash;&#8220;We mustn&#8217;t
get to be like these New Yorkers. Our happiness
lies right here with ourselves and our children.
I&#8217;ll be satisfied if we bring them up to
be honest, useful men and women.&#8221; That&#8217;s
the way a woman should talk and feel. When
they get the ideas that are fit only for men
everything goes to pot.</p>

<p>But to return to the Judson dinner&mdash;my
wife and I had never before been in so grand
a house. It was, indeed, a grand house for
those days, though it wouldn&#8217;t compare with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
my palace overlooking the park, and would
hardly rank to-day as a second-rate New York
house. We tried to seem at our ease, and I
think my wife succeeded; but it seemed to me
that Judson and his wife were seeing into my
embarrassment and were enjoying it as evidence
of their superiority. I may have
wronged him. Possibly I was seeking more
reasons to hate him in order the better to justify
myself for what I was about to do. But
that isn&#8217;t important.</p>

<p>My wife and I were as if in a dream or a
daze. A whole, new world was opening to
both of us&mdash;the world of fashion, luxury, and
display. True, we had seen it from the outside
before; and had had it constantly before
our eyes; but now we were touching it, tasting
it, smelling it&mdash;were almost grasping it. We
were unhappy as we drove home in our ill-smelling
public cab, and when we reentered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
our little world it seemed humble and
narrow and mean&mdash;a ridiculous fool&#8217;s paradise.</p>

<p>We did not have our customary before-going-to-sleep
talk that night, about my business,
about our investments, about the household,
about the children&mdash;we had two, the
boys, then. We lay side by side, silent and
depressed. I heard her sigh several times, but
I did not ask her why&mdash;I understood. Finally
I said to her: &#8220;Minnie, how&#8217;d you like to live
like the Judsons? You know we can afford
to spread out a good deal. Things have
been coming our way for twelve years, and
soon&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She sighed again. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether
I&#8217;m fitted for it,&#8221; she said; &#8220;I think all those
grand things would frighten me. I&#8217;d make
a fool of myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>It amuses me to recall how simple she was.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
Who would ever suspect her of having been
so, as she presides over our great establishments
in town and in the country as if she
were born to it? &#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; I answered.
&#8220;You&#8217;d soon get used to it. You&#8217;re young
yet, and a thousand times better looking than
fat old Mrs. Judson. You&#8217;ll learn in no time.
You&#8217;ll go up with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re as happy as we are,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;I ought to be ashamed of myself
to be so envious and ungrateful.&#8221; But she
sighed again.</p>

<p>I think she soon went to sleep. I lay awake
hour after hour, a confusion of thoughts in
my mind&mdash;we worry a great deal over nice
points in morals when we are young. Then,
suddenly, as it seemed to me, the command of
destiny came&mdash;&#8220;You can be sole master, in
name as well as in fact. You <i>are</i> that business.
He has no right there. Put him out! He is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
only a drag, and will soon ruin everything.
It is best for him&mdash;and you <i>must</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>I tossed and turned. I said to myself, &#8220;No!
No!&#8221; But I knew what I would do. I was
not the man to toil for years for an object and
then let weakness cheat me out of it. I knew
I would make short shrift of a flabby and
dangerous and short-sighted generosity when
the time came.</p>

<p>One morning, about six months later, Mr.
Judson came to me as I was busy at my desk
and laid down a note for five hundred thousand
dollars, signed by himself. &#8220;It&#8217;ll be all
right for me to indorse the firm&#8217;s name upon
that, won&#8217;t it?&#8221; he said, in a careless tone,
holding to a corner of the note, as if he were
assuming that I would say &#8220;Yes,&#8221; and he
could then take it away.</p>

<p>A thrill of delight ran through me at this
stretch of the hand of my opportunity for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
which I had been planning for years, and for
which I had been waiting in readiness for
nearly three months. I looked steadily at the
note. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; I said, slowly, raising
my eyes to his. His eyes shifted and a hurt
expression came into them, as if he, not I, were
refusing. &#8220;I&#8217;m busy just now. Leave it,
won&#8217;t you? I&#8217;ll look at it presently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, certainly,&#8221; he said, in a surprised, shy
voice. I did not look up at him again, but I
saw that his hand&mdash;a narrow, smooth hand,
not at all like mine&mdash;was trembling as he drew
it away.</p>

<p>We did not speak again until late in the
afternoon. Then I had to go to him about
some other matter, and, as I was turning
away, he said, timidly: &#8220;Oh, about that
note&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be indorsed by the firm,&#8221; I said,
abruptly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>There was a long silence between us. I felt
that he was inwardly resenting what he must
be calling the insolence of the &#8220;upstart&#8221; he
had &#8220;created.&#8221; I was hating him for the contemptuous
thoughts that seemed to me to be
burning through the silence from his brain to
mine, was hating him for putting me in a false
position even before myself with his plausible
appearance of being a generous gentleman&mdash;I
abhor the idea of &#8220;gentleman&#8221; in business;
it upsets everything, at once.</p>

<p>When he did speak, he only said: &#8220;Why
not?&#8221;</p>

<p>I went to my desk and brought a sheet of
paper filled with figures. &#8220;I have made this
up since you spoke to me this morning,&#8221; I
said, laying it before him.</p>

<p>That was false&mdash;a trifling falsehood to prevent
him from misunderstanding my conduct
in making a long and quiet investigation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
The truth is that that crucial paper was the
work of a great many days, and not a few
nights, of thought and labour&mdash;it was my cast
for my million.</p>

<p>The paper seemed to show at a glance that
the firm was practically ruined, and that Mr.
Judson himself was insolvent. It was to a
certain extent an over-statement, or, rather, a
sort of anticipation of conditions that would
come to pass within a year or two if Mr. Judson
were permitted to hold to his course.
While in a sense I took advantage of his ignorance
of our business and his own, and also
of his lack of familiarity with all commercial
matters, yet, on the other hand, it was not
sensible that I should tide him over and
carry him, and it was vitally necessary
that I should get my million. Had he
been shrewder, I should have got it anyhow,
only I should have been compelled to use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
methods that, perhaps, would have seemed less
merciful.</p>

<p>I sat beside him as he read; and, while I
pitied him, for I am human, after all, I felt
more strongly a sense of triumph, that I, the
poor, the obscure, by sheer force of intellect,
had raised myself up to where I had my
foot upon the neck of this proud man, ranking
so high among New York&#8217;s distinguished
merchants and citizens. I have had many a
triumph since, and over men far superior to
Judson; but I do not think that I have ever
so keenly enjoyed any other victory as this,
my first and most important.</p>

<p>Still, I pitied him as he read, with face
growing older and older, and, with his pride
shot through the vitals, quivering in its death
agony. I said, gently, when he had finished
and had buried his face in his hands: &#8220;Now,
do you understand, Mr. Judson, why I won&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
sign away my commercial honour and my
children&#8217;s bread?&#8221;</p>

<p>He shrank and shivered, as if, instead of
having spoken kindly to him, I had struck
him. &#8220;Spare me!&#8221; he said, brokenly. &#8220;For
God&#8217;s sake, spare me!&#8221; and, after a moment,
he groaned and exclaimed: &#8220;and I&mdash;<i>I</i>&mdash;have
ruined this house, established by my grandfather
and held in honour for half a century!&#8221;
A longer pause, then he lifted his haggard
face&mdash;he looked seventy rather than fifty-five;
his eyeballs were sunk in deep, blue-black
sockets; his whole expression was an awful
warning of the consequences of recklessness in
business. I have never forgotten it. &#8220;I trust
you,&#8221; he said; &#8220;what shall I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>He placed himself entirely in my hands; or,
rather, he left his affairs where they had been,
except when he was muddling them, for more
than six years. I dealt generously by him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
for I bought him out by the use of my excellent
personal credit, and left him a small
fortune in such shape that he could easily
manage it. He was free of all business cares;
I had taken upon my shoulders not only the
responsibilities of that great business, but also
a load of debt which would have staggered
and frightened a man of less courageous
judgment.</p>

<p>I did not see him when the last papers were
signed&mdash;he was ill and they were sent to his
house. Two or three weeks later I heard that
he was convalescent and went to see him.
Now that he was no longer in my way, and
that the debt of gratitude was transferred
from me to him, I had only the kindliest,
friendliest feelings for him. Those few weeks
had made a great change in me. I had grown,
I had come into my own, I realised how high
I was above the mass of my fellow-men, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
I was insisting upon and was receiving the
respect that was my due. My sensations, as
I entered the Judson house, were vastly different
from what they were when the pompous
butler admitted me on the occasion of
the one previous visit, and I could see that he
felt strongly the alteration in my station. I
felt generous pity as I went into the library
and looked down at the broken old failure
huddled in a big chair. What an unlovely
thing is failure, especially grey-haired failure!
I said to myself: &#8220;How fortunate for
him that this helpless creature fell into my
hands instead of into the hands of some rascal
or some cruel and vindictive man!&#8221; I was
about to speak, but something in his steady
gaze restrained me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have admitted you,&#8221; he said, in a surprisingly
steady voice, when he had looked
me through and through, &#8220;because I wish you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
to hear from me that I know the truth. My
son-in-law returned from Europe last week,
and, learning what changes had been made,
went over all the papers.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked as if he expected me to flinch.
But I did not. Was not my conscience clear?</p>

<p>&#8220;I know how basely you have betrayed
me,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;I thank you for not taking
everything. I confess your generosity
puzzles me. However, you have done nothing
for which the law can touch you. What
you have stolen is securely yours. I wish you
joy of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>My temper is not of the sweetest&mdash;dealing
with the trickeries and stupidities of little men
soon exhausts the patience of a man who has
much to do in the world, and knows how it
should be done. But never before or since
have I been so insanely angry. I burst into
a torrent of abuse. He rang the bell; and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
when the servant came, calm and clear above
my raging rose his voice, saying, &#8220;Robert,
show this person to the door.&#8221; For the moment
my mind seemed paralysed. I left,
probably looking as base and guilty as he with
his wounded vanity and his sufferings from
the loss of all he had thrown away imagined
me to be.</p>

<p>I confess that that was a very bad quarter
of an hour. But, to make a large success in
this world, and in the brief span of a lifetime,
one must submit to discomforts of that kind
occasionally. There are compensating hours.
I had one last week when I attended the dedication
of the splendid two-million-dollar recitation
hall I have given to &mdash;&mdash; University.</p>

<p>Not until I was several blocks from Judson&#8217;s
did the sense of my wrongs sting me
into rage again. I remember that I said:
&#8220;Infamous ingratitude! I save this fine gentleman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
from bankruptcy, and my reward is
that he calls me a thief&mdash;me, a millionaire!&#8221;</p>

<p>Millionaire! In that word there was a
magic balm for all the wounds to my pride
and my then supersensitive conscience&mdash;a justification
of the past, a guarantee of the
future.</p>

<p>With my million safely achieved, I looked
about me as a conqueror looks upon the conquered.
A thousand dollars saved is the first
step toward a competence; a million dollars
achieved is the first step toward a Cr&#339;sus;
and, in matters of money, as in everything
else, &#8220;it is the first step that counts,&#8221; as the
French say. I was filled with the passion for
more, more, more. I felt myself, in imagination,
growing mightier and mightier, lifting
myself higher and more dazzlingly above the
dull mass of work-a-day people with their
routines of petty concerns.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>In the days of our modesty my wife used
to plan that we would retire when we had
twenty thousand a year&mdash;enough, she then
thought, to provide for every want, reasonable
or unreasonable, that we and the children
could have. Now, she would have scorned
the idea of retiring as contemptuously as I
would. She was eager to do her part in the
process of expansion and aggrandisement,
was eager to see us socially established, to put
our children in the position to make advantageous
marriages. We would be outshone in
New York by none!</p>

<p>To win a million is to taste blood. The
million-mania&mdash;for, in a sense, I&#8217;ll admit it is
a mania&mdash;is roused and put upon the scent,
and it never sleeps again, nor is its appetite
ever satisfied or even made less ravenous.</p>

<p>A few years, and I left dry-goods for
finance, where the pursuit of my passion was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
more direct and more rapidly successful.
Every day I fixed my thoughts upon another
million; and, as all who know anything about
the million-mania will tell you, the act of fixing
the thought upon a million, when one has
earned the right to acquire millions, makes
that million yours, makes all who stand between
you and it aggressors to be clawed down
and torn to pieces. As I grew my rights were
respected more and more deferentially. Men
now bow before me. They understand that
I can administer great wealth to the best advantage,
that I belong to one of that small
class of beings created to possess the earth
and to command the improvident and idealess
inhabitants thereof how and where and when
to work.</p>

<p>My family?</p>

<p>I confess they have not risen to my level
or to the opportunities I have made for them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
Naturally, with great wealth, the old simple
family relationship was broken up. That was
to be expected&mdash;the duties of people in our
position do not permit indulgence in the simple
emotions and pastimes of the family life
of the masses. But neither, on the other hand,
was it necessary that my wife should become
a cold and calculating social figure, full of
vanity and superciliousness, instead of maintaining
the proud dignity of her position as
my wife. Nor was it necessary that my children
should become selfish, heartless, pleasure-seekers,
caring nothing for me except as a
source of money.</p>

<p>I suppose I am in part responsible&mdash;my
great enterprises have left me little time for
the small details of life, such as the training
of children. They were admirably educated,
too. I provided the best governesses and masters,
and saw to it that they learned all that a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
lady or a gentleman should know; and in
respect of dress and manners I admit that
they do very well, indeed. Possibly, the complete
breaking up of the family, except as it is
held together by my money, is due to the fact
that we see so little of one another, each having
his or her separate establishment. Possibly
I am a little old-fashioned, a little too
exacting, in my idea of wife and children.
Certainly they are aristocratic enough.</p>

<p>My son James is the thorn in my side.
And, whenever I have a moment&#8217;s rest from
my affairs, I find myself thinking of him,
worrying over him. The latest development
in his character is certainly disquieting.</p>

<p>He was twenty-five years old yesterday.
He was educated at our most aristocratic university
here, and at one in Europe of the same
kind. It was his mother&#8217;s dream that he
should be &#8220;brought up as a gentleman&#8221;; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
that fell in with my ideas, for I did not wish
him to be a money-maker, but the head of the
family I purposed to found upon my millions,
which are already numerous enough to secure
it for many generations. &#8220;There is no call for
him to struggle and toil as I have,&#8221; I said to
myself. &#8220;The sort of financial ability I possess
is born in a man and can&#8217;t be taught or
transmitted by birth. He would make a small
showing, at best, as a business man. As a
gentleman he will shine. He only needs just
enough business training to enable him to
supervise those who will take care of his
fortune and that of the rich woman he will
marry.&#8221; I was determined that he should
marry in his own class&mdash;and, indeed, he is not
a sentimentalist, and, therefore, is not likely
to disregard my wishes in that matter.</p>

<p>When he was eighteen I caught him in a
fashionable gambling-house one night when I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
thought he was at his college. I could not
but admire the coolness with which he made
the best of it: stood beside me as I sat playing
faro, then went over to a roulette table and
lost several hundred dollars on a few spins of
the ball. But the next day I took him sharply
to task&mdash;it was one thing for me to play, at
my age and with my fortune, I explained, but
not the same for him, at his age, and with
nothing but an allowance.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders indifferently.
&#8220;Really, governor,&#8221; he said, &#8220;a man must do
as the other fellows in his set do. Didn&#8217;t you
see whom I was with? If you wish me to
travel with those people I must go their gait.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was not unreasonable, so I dismissed
him with a cautioning. At twenty he went
abroad, and, a year after he had returned, his
bills and drafts were still coming. I sent for
him. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you pay your debts, sir?&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
I demanded, angrily, for such conduct was
directly contrary to my teaching and example.</p>

<p>He gave me his grandest look&mdash;he is a
handsome, aristocratic-looking fellow, away
ahead of what Judson must have been at his
age. &#8220;But, my dear governor,&#8221; he said, &#8220;a
gentleman pays his debts when he feels like
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he don&#8217;t,&#8221; I answered, furiously, for
my instinct of commercial promptness was
roused. &#8220;A scoundrel pays his debts when he
feels like it. A gentleman pays &#8217;em when
they&#8217;re due.&#8221;</p>

<p>His reply was a smile of approval, and
&#8220;Excellent! The best epigram I&#8217;ve heard
since I left Paris. You&#8217;re as great a genius
at making phrases as you are at making
money.&#8221;</p>

<p>I caught him speculating in Wall Street&mdash;&#8220;One
must amuse one&#8217;s self,&#8221; he said, cheerfully.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
But I was not to be put off this time.
I had had some reports on his life&mdash;many
wild escapades, many fantastic extravagances.
The terrible downfall of two young men of
his set made me feel that the time for discipline
was at hand. But, as I was very busy,
I had only time to read him a brief lecture
on speculation and to exact from him a promise
that he would keep out of Wall Street.
He gave the promise so reluctantly that I felt
confident he meant to keep it.</p>

<p>A week ago yesterday morning he came into
my bedroom, before I was up, and said to my
valet, Pigott: &#8220;Just take yourself off, Piggy!&#8221;
And, when we were alone, he began:
&#8220;Mother said I was to come straight to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; I demanded, my anger rising&mdash;experience
has taught me that the more
offhand his manner, the more serious the offence
I should have to repair.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>&#8220;I broke my promise to you about speculating,
sir,&#8221; he replied, much as if he were
apologising for having jostled me in a crowd.</p>

<p>I sat up in bed, feeling as if I were afire.
&#8220;And does a gentleman keep his promises
only when he feels like it?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;But that isn&#8217;t all,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;My
pool&#8217;s gone smash&mdash;you were on the other side
and I never suspected it. And I&#8217;ve got a
million to pay, besides&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He took out his cigarette case, and lighted
a cigarette with great deliberation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Besides&mdash;what?&#8221; I said, wishing to know
all before I began upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wrote your name across the back of a
bit of paper,&#8221; he answered, hiding his face in
a big cloud of smoke.</p>

<p>I fell back in the bed, feeling as if I had
been struck on the head with a heavy weight.
&#8220;You scoundrel!&#8221; I gasped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>&#8220;Sour grapes,&#8221; he muttered, his cheeks
aflame and his eyes blazing at me.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_038.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;<i>&#8216;Don&#8217;t get apoplectic,&#8217; he said, calmly; &#8216;you know you
stole your start.&#8217;</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; I said, my mind in
confusion.</p>

<p>&#8220;The fathers have eaten sour grapes,&#8221; he
quoted, &#8220;and the children&#8217;s teeth are set on
edge.&#8221;</p>

<p>I half sprang from the bed at this insolence.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t get apoplectic,&#8221; he said, calmly; &#8220;you
know you stole your start.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this infamous calumny I leaped upon
him and flung him bodily out of the room. It
was several hours before I was calm enough
to dismiss the incident sufficiently to take up
my affairs.</p>

<p>This has come at a particularly unfortunate
time for me, as I am in the midst of several
delicate, vast, and intricate negotiations, involving
many millions and demanding all my
thought. He has gone down on Long Island<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
in care of his mother. It will be at least ten
days before I can take up his case and dispose
of it. I am undecided whether to give
him another trial under severe conditions or
to cast him off and make his younger brother
my principal heir and successor. I confess to
a weakness for him&mdash;possibly because he is so
audacious and fearless. His younger brother
is entirely too smooth and diplomatic with me;
if I should elevate him, he would fancy that
he had deceived me with his transparent tricks.</p>

<p>However, we shall see.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">II</h2>
</div>


<p>About a month after I sent James to my
place on Long Island to be in the custody of
his mother, I was dining in my Fifth Avenue
house with only Burridge, my secretary, and
Jack Ridley, who calls himself my &#8220;court
fool.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although my mind was crowded with large
affairs involving great properties and millions
of capital, hardly a day had passed without
my thinking of James and of his infamous
conduct toward me. But without neglecting
the duties which my position as a financial
leader impose upon me, it was impossible for
me to take time to do my duty as a parent.
The duty which particularly pressed and absolutely
prevented me from attending to my
son was that of overcoming difficulties I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
encountered in consolidating the three railways
which I control in the State. To achieve
my purpose it was necessary that a somewhat
radical change be made in a certain law. I
sent my agent to Boss &mdash;&mdash; to arrange the
matter. I learned that he refused to order the
change unless I would pay him three hundred
thousand dollars in cash and would give him
the opportunity to buy to a like amount of the
new stock at par. He pleaded that the change
would cause a tremendous outcry if it were
discovered, as it almost certainly would be,
and that he must be in a position to provide
a correspondingly large campaign fund to
&#8220;carry the party&#8221; successfully through the
next campaign. He said his past favours to
me had brought him to the verge of political
ruin. In a sentence, the miserable old blackmailer
was trying to drive as hard a bargain
with me as if I had not been making stiff<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
contributions to what he calls his &#8220;campaign
fund&#8221; for years with only trifling favours in
return. I was willing to pay what the change
was worth, but I would not be bled. I
brought pressure to bear from the national
organisation of his party, and he came round&mdash;apparently.</p>

<p>Just as my bill was slipping quietly through
the State Senate, having passed the Lower
House unobserved, the other boss raised a terrific
hullabaloo. Boss &mdash;&mdash; denied to my people
that he had &#8220;tipped off&#8221; what was doing
in order to revenge himself and get his blood-money
in another way; but I knew at once
that the sanctimonious old thief had outwitted
me.</p>

<p>It looked as if I would have to yield. Of
course I should have done so in the last straits,
for only a fool holds out for a principle when
holding out means no gain and a senseless and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
costly loss. But the knowledge that a defeat
would cost me dear in future transactions of
this kind made me struggle desperately. I
sent for my lawyer, Stratton&mdash;an able fellow,
as lawyers go, but, like most of this stupid,
lazy human race, always ready to say &#8220;impossible&#8221;
because saying so saves labour. &#8220;Stratton,&#8221;
I said, &#8220;there must be a way round&mdash;there
always is. Can&#8217;t I get what I want by
an amendment to some other law that can be
slipped through by the lobby of some other
corporation as if for its benefit only? Take
a week. Paw over the books and rake that
brain of yours! There&#8217;s a hundred and fifty
thousand in it for you if you find me the way
round.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the law&mdash;&#8221; he began.</p>

<p>I lost my temper&mdash;I always do when one
of my men begins his reply to an order I&#8217;ve
given him with the word &#8220;But.&#8221; &#8220;Don&#8217;t &#8216;but&#8217;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
me, damn you,&#8221; said I. &#8220;I&#8217;m getting sick
and tired of your eternal opposition. Crawford&#8221;&mdash;Crawford
was my lawyer until I put
him into the Senate&mdash;&#8220;used always to tell me
how I could do what I wanted to do. You&#8217;re
always telling me that I can&#8217;t do what I want
to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to displease you, sir, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;But&#8217; again!&#8221; I exclaimed, sarcastically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, however,&#8221; he went on, with a conciliatory
smile, &#8220;I&#8217;m not a legislator; I&#8217;m a
lawyer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely,&#8221; said I. &#8220;And the only use I
have for a lawyer is to show me how to do as
I please, in spite of these wretched demagogues
and blackmailers that control the
statute-books. If you are as intelligent as
Crawford led me to believe and as my own
observation of you suggests, you&#8217;ll profit by
this little talk we&#8217;ve had. Look round you at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
the men who are making the big successes in
your profession nowadays&mdash;look at your predecessor,
Crawford. Imitate them and stop
casting about for ways of interpreting the law
against your employer&#8217;s interest.&#8221;</p>

<p>Two days later he came to me in triumph.
He had found the &#8220;way round.&#8221; I had my
law slipped through, signed by the Governor,
and safely put on the statute-book, the two
bosses as unsuspicious as were the newspapers
and the public. Then I came out in a public
disavowal of my original purpose, denounced
it as a crime against the people, and deplored
that my railroad corporation should be unjustly
accused of promoting it. You must
fight the devil with fire.</p>

<p>Those two bosses&mdash;and the sensational newspapers
that had been attacking them and my
corporations&mdash;were astounded, and haven&#8217;t
recovered yet. It will be six months before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
they realise that I have accomplished my purpose;
even then they won&#8217;t be sure that I
planned it, but will half believe it was my
&#8220;luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>In passing, I may note that Stratton tells
me I ought to pay him two hundred and fifty
thousand dollars instead of one hundred and
fifty thousand&mdash;for pulling me out of the
hole! He has wholly forgotten having said
&#8220;can&#8217;t be done&#8221; and &#8220;impossible&#8221; to me so
many times that I finally had to stop him by
cursing him violently. With their own vanity
and their women-folks&#8217; flattery for ever conspiring
to destroy their judgment, it&#8217;s a wonder
to me that men are able to get on at all.
Indeed, they wouldn&#8217;t if they didn&#8217;t have
masters like me over them.</p>

<p>After I had got my little joke on the bosses
and the impertinent public safely on the statute-book,
there remained the problem of how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
to take advantage of it without stirring up
the sensational newspapers and the politicians,
always ready to pander to the spirit of demagogy.
I had my rights safely embodied in
the law; but in this lawless time that is not
enough. Instead of being respectful to the
great natural leaders and deferential to their
larger vision and larger knowledge, the
people regard us with suspicion and overlook
our services in their envy of the trifling
commissions we get&mdash;for, what is the
wealth we reserve for ourselves in comparison
with the benefits we confer upon the
country?</p>

<p>At this dinner which I have mentioned, both
Burridge and Ridley were silent, and so my
thoughts had no distraction. As I know that
it is bad for my digestion to use my brain as
I eat, I tried to start a conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you seen Aurora to-day?&#8221; I asked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
Burridge. She is my eldest daughter, just
turned eighteen.</p>

<p>&#8220;She and Walter&#8221;&mdash;he is my second son,
within a month or so of twenty-two&mdash;&#8220;are
dining out this evening; she at Carnarvon&#8217;s,
he at Longview&#8217;s. I think they meet at Mrs.
Hollister&#8217;s dance and come home together.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was agreeable news. The names told
me that my wife was at last succeeding in her
social campaign, thanks to the irresistible
temptation to the narrow aristocrats of the
inner circle in the prospective fortunes of my
children. While this social campaign of ours
has its vanity side&mdash;and I here admit that I
am not insensible to certain higher kinds of
vanity&mdash;it also has a substantial business side.
The greatest disadvantage I have laboured under&mdash;and
at times it was serious&mdash;has been a
certain suspicion of me as a newcomer and an
adventurer. Naturally this has not been lessened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
by the boldness and swiftness of my
operations. When I and my family are admitted
on terms of intimacy and perfect
equality among the people of large and old-established
fortune, I shall be absolutely
trusted in the financial world and shall be
secure in the position of leadership which my
brains have won for me and which I now
maintain only by steady fighting.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Helen?&#8221; I went on. Helen is my
other daughter, not yet twelve.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s dining in her own sitting-room with
her companion,&#8221; replied Burridge.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen her for a day or two,&#8221; I
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two weeks to-morrow,&#8221; answered Burridge.</p>

<p>Jack Ridley laughed, and I frowned. It
irritates me for Ridley to note it whenever I
am caught in seeming neglect of my children.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
He pretends not to believe that it is my sense
of duty that makes me deprive myself of the
family happiness of ordinary men for the sake
of my larger duties. But he must know at the
bottom that all my self-sacrifice is for my children,
for my family, ultimately. I have the
thankless, misunderstood toil; they have the
enjoyment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two weeks!&#8221; I protested; &#8220;it can&#8217;t be!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She came to me for her allowance this
morning,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and she asked after you.
She said your valet had told her you were
staying here and were well. She said she&#8217;d
like to see you some time&mdash;if you ever got
round to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>This little picture of my domestic life did
not tend to cheer me. Naturally, I went on
to think of Jim. Ridley interrupted my
thoughts by saying: &#8220;Have you been down on
Long Island yet?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>This was going too far even for a &#8220;court
fool&#8221;&mdash;his name for himself, not mine. Ridley
is my pensioner, confidant, listening machine,
and talking machine. He is of an old
New York family, an honest, intelligent fellow,
with an extravagant stomach and back.
My wife engaged him, originally, to help her
in her social campaigns. I saw that I could
use him to better advantage, and he has gradually
grown into my confidence.</p>

<p>In my lesser days, one of the things that
most irritated me against the very rich was
their habit of buying human beings, body and
soul, to do all kinds of unmanly work, and I
especially abhorred the &#8220;parasites&#8221;&mdash;so I
called them&mdash;who hung about rich men, entertaining
them, submitting to their humours,
and bearing degradations and humiliations in
exchange for the privileges of eating at luxurious
tables, living in the colder corners of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
palaces, driving in the carriages of their
patrons, and being received nominally as their
social equals. But now I understand these
matters better. It isn&#8217;t given to many men to
be independent. As for the &#8220;parasites,&#8221; how
should I do without Jack Ridley?</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t have friends. Friends take one&#8217;s
time&mdash;they must be treated with consideration,
or they become dangerous enemies. Friends
impose upon one&#8217;s friendship&mdash;they demand
inconvenient or improper, or, at any rate,
costly favours which it is difficult to refuse.
I must have companionship, and fate compels
that my companion shall be my dependant,
one completely under my control&mdash;a Jack
Ridley. I look after his expensive stomach
and back; he amuses me and keeps me informed
as to the trifling matters of art, literature,
gossip, and so forth, which I have no
time to look up, yet must know if I am to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
make any sort of appearance in company.
Really, next to my gymnasium, I regard poor
old Jack as my most useful belonging, so far
as my health and spirits are concerned.</p>

<p>To his impertinent reminder of my neglected
duty I made no reply beyond a heavy
frown. The rest of the dinner was eaten in
oppressive silence, I brooding over the absence
of cheerfulness in my life. They say it is my
fault, but I know it is simply their stupidity
in being unable to understand how to deal with
a superior personality. It is my fate to be
misunderstood, publicly and privately. The
public grudgingly praises, often even derides,
my philanthropies; the members of my family
laugh at my generosities and self-sacrifices for
them.</p>

<p>As I was going to my apartment and to
bed, Ridley waylaid me. &#8220;You&#8217;re offended
with me, old man?&#8221; he asked, his eyes moist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
and his lips trembling under his grey moustache.
He weeps easily: at a glass of especially
fine wine; over a sentimental story in a
paper or magazine; if a grouse is cooked just
right; when I am cross with him. And I
think all his emotions, whether of heart or of
stomach, are genuine&mdash;and probably about as
valuable as most emotions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all, not at all, Jack,&#8221; I said, reassuringly;
&#8220;but you ought to be careful when
you see I&#8217;m low in my mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do go down to see the boy,&#8221; he went on,
earnestly. &#8220;He&#8217;s a good boy at heart, as
good as he is handsome and clever. Give
him a little of your precious time and
he&#8217;ll be worth more to you than all your
millions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a young scalawag,&#8221; said I, pretending
to harden. &#8220;I&#8217;m almost convinced that
it&#8217;s my duty to drive him out and cut him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
off altogether. After all I&#8217;ve done for
him! After all the pains I&#8217;ve taken with
him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ridley looked at me timidly, but found
courage to say: &#8220;He told me he&#8217;d never talked
with you so much as sixty consecutive minutes
in his whole life!&#8221;</p>

<p>This touched me at the moment. I&#8217;m soft
at times, where my family is concerned. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
see; I&#8217;ll see,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Perhaps I can go down
to him Sunday. But don&#8217;t annoy me about
it again, Jack!&#8221; There&#8217;s a limit to my good-nature,
even with poor old well-meaning
Ridley.</p>

<p>But other matters pressed in, and it was the
following Monday and then the following
Saturday before I knew it. Then came the
first Sunday in the month, and Burridge, as
usual, brought in the preceding month&#8217;s domestic
accounts as soon as I had settled myself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
at breakfast after my run and swim and rubdown
in my &#8220;gym&#8221; in the basement. As a
rule, at that time I&#8217;m in my best possible humour.
My wife and children know it and lie
in wait then with any particularly impudent
requests for favours or particularly outrageous
confessions that must be made. But on
the first Sunday in the month even my &#8220;gym&#8221;
can&#8217;t put me in good-humour. I am a liberal
man. My large gifts to education and charity
and my generosity with my family prove
it beyond a doubt. My wife looks scornful
when I speak of this. Her theory is that my
public gifts are an exhibition of my vanity,
and that my establishments, my yacht, etc.,
etc., are partly vanity, and partly my selfish
passion for my own comfort. She, however,
never attributes a good motive or instinct to
me, or to any one else, nowadays. Really, the
change in her since our modest days is incredible.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
It is amazing how arrogant affluence
makes women.</p>

<p>But, as I was saying, my monthly bill-day
is too much for my good-humour. It is not the
money going out that I mind so much, though
I&#8217;m not ashamed to admit that it is not so
agreeable to me to see money going out as it
is to see money coming in. The real irritation
is the waste&mdash;the wanton, wicked, dangerous
waste.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t attend to details. I can&#8217;t visit kitchens,
do marketing, superintend housekeepers
and butlers, oversee stables, and buy all the
various supplies. I can&#8217;t shop for furniture
and clothing, and look after the entertainments.
All those things are my wife&#8217;s business
and duty. And she has a secretary, and
a housekeeper, and Burridge, and Ridley, to
assist her. Yet the bills mount and mount;
the waste grows and grows. Extravagance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
for herself, extravagance for her children,
thousands thrown away with nothing whatever
to show for it! The money runs away
like water at a left-on faucet.</p>

<p>The result is the almost complete estrangement
between my wife and me. Every month
we have a fierce quarrel over the waste, often
a quarrel that lasts the month through and
breaks out afresh every time we meet. She
denounces me as a miser, a vulgarian. She
goads me into furious outbursts before the
children. What with my battles against stupidity
and insolence down-town, and my battles
against waste in my family, my life is one
long contention. However, I suppose this is
the lot of all the great men who play large
parts on the world&#8217;s stage. No wonder those
who fancy we are on earth to seek and find
happiness regard life as a ghastly fraud.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the demnition total, Burridge?&#8221; I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
asked, when he appeared with his arms full of
books and papers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ninety-two thousand, four, twenty-six,
fifty-one,&#8221; he answered, in a tone of abject
apology.</p>

<p>I could not restrain an indignant expostulation.
&#8220;That&#8217;s seventy-three hundred and
four above last month. Impossible! You&#8217;ve
made a mistake in adding.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went over his figures nervously and
flushed scarlet. &#8220;I beg your pardon, sir,&#8221; he
said, in a tone of terror. &#8220;The total is ninety-five
thousand instead of ninety-two.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ten thousand-odd above month before last!
Eighty-nine hundred above the same month
last year! I had to restrain myself from
physical violence to Burridge. I ordered
him out of the room&mdash;giving as my reason
anger at his mistake in addition. I wanted
to hear no more, as I felt sure the details of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
the shameful waste would put me in a rage
which would impair my health. The total
was enough for my purpose&mdash;we were now
living at the rate of more than a million dollars
a year! I took the eleven o&#8217;clock train for my
place on Long Island.</p>

<p>When I reached my railway station none of
my traps was there. In my angry preoccupation
I had forgotten to telephone from the
Fifth Avenue house; and, of course, neither
Pigott nor the butler nor Burridge nor Ridley
nor any of my herd of blockhead servants
had had the consideration to repair my oversight.
Yet there are fools who say money will
buy everything. Sometimes I think it won&#8217;t
buy anything but annoyances.</p>

<p>So I had to go to my place in a rickety,
smelly station-surrey&mdash;and that did not soothe
my rage. However, as I drove into and
through my grounds&mdash;there isn&#8217;t a finer park<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
on Long Island&mdash;I began to feel somewhat
better. There is nothing like lands and houses
to give one the sensation of wealth, of possession.
I have often gone into my vaults and
have looked at the big bundles and boxes of
securities; and, by setting my imagination to
work, I have got some sort of notion how vast
my wealth and power are. But bits of paper
supplemented by imagination are not equal to
the tangible, seeable things&mdash;just as a hundred-dollar
bill can&#8217;t give one the sensation in
the fingers and in the eyes that a ten-dollar
gold piece gives. That is why I like my big
houses and my city lots and my parked acres
in the country&mdash;yes, and my yacht and carriages
and furniture, my servants and horses
and dogs, my family&#8217;s jewels and finery.</p>

<p>But the instant I entered the house my
spirits soured again, curdled into an acid
fury.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>I had sent my son down there with his
mother to await my sentence upon him for his
crimes&mdash;his insults to me, his waste of nearly
a million of my money, his violation of his
word of honour, his forgery. I had been assuming
that in those five weeks of waiting he
was suffering from remorse and suspense, was
thinking of his crimes against me and of my
anger and justice. As I entered the large
drawing-room unannounced, they were about
to go in to luncheon. &#8220;They&#8221; means my wife
and James, and Walter and Aurora, who had
gone down to the country for the week-end.
&#8220;They&#8221; means also ten others, six of whom
were guests staying in the house. As I stood
dumfounded, five more who had been to
church came trooping in. I had gone, expecting
a house of mourning. I had found
a revel.</p>

<p>At sight of me the laughter and conversation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
died. My wife coloured. James looked
abashed for a moment. Then&mdash;what a well-mannered,
self-possessed dog he is!&mdash;he burst
out laughing. &#8220;Fairly trapped!&#8221; he said.
And he went on to explain to the others:
&#8220;The governor and I had a little fall-out, and
he sent me down here to play with the ashes.
You&#8217;ve caught me with the goods on me, governor.
It&#8217;s up to me&mdash;I&#8217;ve got to square myself.
So I&#8217;ll pay by giving you the two prettiest
young girls in the room to sit on either
side of you at luncheon. Let&#8217;s go in, for I&#8217;m
half-starved.&#8221;</p>

<p>As all the women in the room except three&mdash;including
Aurora&mdash;were married, James&#8217;s
remark was doubly adroit. What could I do
but put aside my wrath and set my guests at
their ease?</p>

<p>This was the less difficult to do as Natalie
Bradish and Horton Kirkby were among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
guests&mdash;and stopping in the house. I have
long had my eye on Miss Bradish as the
proper wife for James or Walter&mdash;whichever
should commend himself to me as my fit successor
at the head of the family I purpose to
found with the bulk of my wealth. She is a
handsome girl; she has a proud, distinguished
look and manner; she will inherit several millions
some day that can&#8217;t be distant, as her
father is in hopelessly bad health; she comes
of a splendid, widely connected family, and is
extremely ambitious and free from sentimental
nonsense. Young Kirkby is the very husband
for Aurora. His great-grandfather
founded their family securely in city real
estate and lived long enough firmly to establish
the tradition of giving the bulk of the
fortune to the eldest male heir. Kirkby is not
brilliant; but Aurora has brains enough for
two, and he has a set of long, curved fingers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
that never relax their hold upon what&#8217;s in
them.</p>

<p>After luncheon I drew my wife away to the
sitting-room for the plain talk which was the
object of my visit. As the presence of Miss
Bradish and Kirkby in the house had lessened
my anger on the score of my wife and son&#8217;s
light-hearted way of looking at his crimes, I
put forward the matter of the expense accounts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Burridge tells me the total for last month
is&mdash;&#8221; I began, and paused. As I was speaking
I was glancing round the room. I had
not been in it for several years. I had just
noted the absence of a Corot I bought ten
years before and paid sixteen thousand dollars
for. I don&#8217;t care for pictures or that sort of
thing, any more than I care for the glitter of
diamonds or the colours of gold and silver in
themselves. I know that most of this talk of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
&#8220;art&#8221; and the like is so much rubbish and affectation.
But works of art, like the precious
stones and metals, have come to be the conventionally
accepted standards of luxury, the
everywhere recognised insignia of the aristocracy
of wealth. So I have them, and add to
my collection steadily just as I add to my collection
of finely bound books that no one ever
opens. What slaves of convention and ostentation
we are!</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s become of the Corot that used to
hang there?&#8221; I asked, suspiciously, because I
had had so many experiences of my family&#8217;s
trifling with my possessions.</p>

<p>My wife smiled scornfully. &#8220;I believe you
carry round in your head an inventory of
everything we&#8217;ve got, even to the last pot in
the kitchen,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The Corot is safe.
It&#8217;s hanging in my bedroom.&#8221;</p>

<p>In her bedroom! A Corot I&#8217;ve been offered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
twenty-five thousand dollars for, and she had
hidden it away in her bedroom! I was irritated
when she put it in her sitting-room where
few people came, for it should have had a good
place in our New York palace. But in her
bedroom, where no one but the servants would
ever have a chance to look at it!</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you put it in the attic or the
cellar?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>She lifted her eyebrows and gave me an
affected, disdainful glance. &#8220;I put it in my
bedroom because I like to look at it,&#8221; she
said.</p>

<p>I laughed. What nonsense! As if any
sensible person&mdash;and she is unquestionably
shrewdly sensible&mdash;ever looks at those things
except when some one is by, noting their &#8220;devotion
to art.&#8221; I said: &#8220;Certainly my family
has the most amazing disregard of money&mdash;of
value. If it were not&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>&#8220;You started to say something about last
month&#8217;s accounts,&#8221; she interrupted.</p>

<p>&#8220;The total was ninety-five thousand,&#8221; I
said, looking sternly at her. &#8220;You are now
living at the rate of more than a million a
year. In ten years we have jumped from
one hundred thousand a year to a million a
year. And this madness grows month by
month.&#8221;</p>

<p>She&mdash;shrugged her shoulders!</p>

<p>&#8220;I came to say to you, madam&mdash;&#8221; I went on,
furiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you look at the items?&#8221; she cut in
coldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I replied; &#8220;I could not trust myself
to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty-seven thousand of last month&#8217;s
expenses went toward paying a small instalment
on your little place for your own amusement
in the Adirondacks. I had nothing to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
do with it. None of us but you will ever go
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was most exasperating. I can&#8217;t account
for my leaping into such a trap, except
on the theory that my preoccupation with the
railway matters must have made me forget
ordering that item into my domestic accounts
instead of into my personal accounts down-town.
Of course, my contention of my family&#8217;s
extravagance was sound. But I had
seemed to give the whole case away, had destroyed
the effect of all I had said, and, as I
glanced at my wife, I saw a triumphant, contemptuous
smile in her eyes. &#8220;You are always
trying to punish some one else for your own
sins,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The truth is that the only
truly prodigal member of the family is yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Me prodigal with my own wealth! But I
did not answer her. One is at a hopeless disadvantage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
in discussion with a woman. They
are insensible to reason and logic except when
they can gain an advantage by using them.
It&#8217;s like having to keep to the rules in a game
where your antagonist keeps to them or makes
his own rules as it suits him. &#8220;Nevertheless,&#8221;
I said, &#8220;the waste in my establishments must
stop and your son James must come to his
senses. It was about him that I came.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor boy&mdash;he&#8217;s had such a bad example
all his life!&#8221; she said. &#8220;My dear, <i>we</i> have no
right to judge him.&#8221;</p>

<p>I knew that she, like him, was throwing up
to me my transactions with Judson. And like
him, she was taking the petty, narrow view of
them. &#8220;Madam,&#8221; I said, &#8220;your son is a liar,
forger, and thief.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then there came a knock at the door
and James&#8217;s voice called: &#8220;May I come in,
mother?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>&#8220;No, go away, Jim. Your father and I are
busy,&#8221; she called in reply.</p>

<p>I went to the door and opened it, beside
myself with fury. &#8220;Come in!&#8221; I exclaimed.
&#8220;It&#8217;s business that concerns you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He entered&mdash;tall and strong, his handsome
face graver than I had ever seen it before.
He closed the door behind him and stood looking
from one to the other of us. &#8220;Well?&#8221; he
said, &#8220;but&mdash;no abuse!&#8221;</p>

<p>Whenever James and I have come face to
face in a crisis I have always had the, to me,
maddening feeling that a will as strong as my
own has been lifting its head defiantly against
me. My wife and my son Walter deal with
me by evasion and slippery trickery. My
daughter Aurora wins from me, when I choose
to let her, by cajolery or tears. Little Helen
has never yet had to do with me in a serious
matter, and I cannot remember her ever a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
me even the trifling favours which most
children seek from their parents. But James
has always played the high and haughty&mdash;and
I am ashamed to think how often he has
ridden me down and defeated me and gained
his object. As I have looked upon him as entitled
to peculiar consideration because I had
planned for him one day to wear my mantle,
he has had me at a disadvantage. But my
indulgent conduct toward him only makes the
blacker his conduct toward me.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_072.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;<i>&#8216;You liar&mdash;you forger!&#8217;</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>As he stood there that day, looking so calm
and superior, I can&#8217;t describe the conflict of
pride in him and hatred of him that surged up
in me. I lost control of myself. I clinched
my fists and shook them in his face. &#8220;You
liar! You forger! You conscienceless&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>His mother rushed between us. &#8220;I knew
it! I knew it!&#8221; she wailed. &#8220;Ever since he
was a baby, I knew this day would come. Oh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
my God! James, my husband&mdash;James, my
son!&#8221;</p>

<p>James lowered the hand he had lifted to
strike me. His face was pale and his eyes
were blazing hate at me&mdash;I saw his real feeling
toward me at last. How could I have
overlooked it so long?</p>

<p>&#8220;Who would ever think you were my father?&#8221;
he asked, in a voice that sounded to me
like an echo of my own. &#8220;You&mdash;with hate
in your face&mdash;hate for the son whom you poisoned
before he was born, whom you have been
poisoning ever since with your example. <i>You</i>&mdash;my
<i>father</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>The young scoundrel had taunted me into
that calm fury which is so dreadful that I fear
it myself&mdash;for, when I am possessed by it,
there is no length to which I would not go.
Our wills had met in final combat. I saw that
I must crush him&mdash;the one human being who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
dared to oppose me and defy me, and he my
own child who should have been deferential,
grateful, obedient, unquestioning. &#8220;But I
am <i>not</i> your father,&#8221; I said. &#8220;In my will I
had made you head of the family, had given
you two-thirds of my estate. I shall write a
revocation here&mdash;immediately. I shall make
a new will to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>If the blow crushed him, he did not show
it. He did not even wince as he saw forty
millions swept away from him. &#8220;As you
please,&#8221; he said, putting scorn into his face
and voice&mdash;as if I could be fooled by such a
pretence. The man never lived who could
scorn a tenth, or even a fortieth, of forty millions.
&#8220;I came into this room,&#8221; he went on,
&#8220;to tell you how ashamed I was of what I
have done&mdash;how vile and low I have felt.
I didn&#8217;t come to apologise to <i>you</i>, but to
my&mdash;my mother and to myself in your presence.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
I am still ashamed of what I did, of
what you made me do. Do you know why I
did it? Because your money, your millions,
have changed you from a man into a monster.
This wealth has injured us all&mdash;yes, even
mother, noble though she is. But you&mdash;it has
made you a fiend. Well, I wished to be independent
of you. You have brought me up
so that I could not live without luxury. But
you haven&#8217;t destroyed in me the last spark of
self-respect. And I decided to make a play
for a fortune of my own. I&mdash;broke my word
and speculated. I overreached&mdash;I saw my
one hope of freeing myself from slavery to
you slipping from me. I&mdash;I&mdash;no matter.
What <i>did</i> matter after I&#8217;d broken my word?
And I was justly punished. I lost&mdash;everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he flung these frightful insults at me
my calm fury grew cold as well. &#8220;You will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
leave the house within an hour,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Your
mother will make your excuses to her guests&mdash;I
shall spare you the humiliation of a public
disowning. During my lifetime you shall
have nothing from me&mdash;no, nor from your
mother. I shall see to that. In my will I shall
leave you a trifling sum&mdash;enough to keep you
alive. I am responsible to society that you
do not become a public charge. And you may
from this day continue on your way to the
penitentiary without hindrance from those
who were your kin.&#8221;</p>

<p>As I finished, he smiled. His smile grew
broader, and became a laugh. &#8220;Very well, ex-father,&#8221;
he said; &#8220;there&#8217;s one inheritance you
can&#8217;t rob me of&mdash;my mind. I&#8217;ll lop off its
rotten spots, and I think what&#8217;s left will enable
me to stagger along.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You imagine I&#8217;ll relent,&#8221; I went on, &#8220;but
my days of weakness with you are over.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>&#8220;You&mdash;relent!&#8221; He smiled mockingly.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not such a fool as to fancy that. Even
if you had a heart, your pride wouldn&#8217;t let
you. And I&#8217;m not sorry&mdash;just at this moment.
Perhaps I shall be later&mdash;I&#8217;m fond of
cash, and your pot for me was a big one. But
just now I feel as if you were doing me a
favour.&#8221; He drew a long breath. &#8220;God!&#8221;
he exclaimed. &#8220;I&#8217;m free! In spite of myself,
I&#8217;m free! I&#8217;m a man at last!&#8221;</p>

<p>I did not care to listen to any more of the
frothings of the silly young fool. Already I
was regarding him as a stranger, was turning
to his brother Walter as a possible successor
to him and my principal heir. I left the room
and went for a walk with my daughter and
Natalie Bradish. When we returned he was
gone. I sent for Walter and told him the
news.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your brother has forfeited everything,&#8221; I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
said, in conclusion. &#8220;It remains for you to
prove yourself worthy of the place I had designed
for him. In the will I shall make to-morrow
my estate will be divided equally
among my three children, your mother getting
her dower rights. If you do not show
the qualities I hope, the will shall stand. If
you do, I shall make another, giving you your
own share plus what I had intended for
James.&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter is a square-shouldered youth of
medium height, with irregular, rather commonplace
features, a rough skin, and an unpleasant
habit of shifting his eyes rapidly
round and round yours as you talk with him&mdash;I
am as impartial a judge of my own family
as a stranger would be. Walter has been
a good deal of a sneak all his life&mdash;at least, he
was up to the time when a man&#8217;s real character
disappears behind the pose he adopts to face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
and fool the world with. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what
to say, sir,&#8221; he said to me now. &#8220;I&#8217;d plead
for my brother, only that you are just and
must have done what was right. I don&#8217;t know
how to thank you for the chance you&#8217;re giving
me. I can&#8217;t hope to come up to your standards,
but I&#8217;ll just keep on trying to do my
best to please you and show my gratitude to
you. I always have been very proud of being
your son. It will make me doubly proud if
I can win your confidence so that you will
select me as head of our family if it should
ever need another head. But all that&#8217;s too far
away to think about.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was much pleased by the modesty and
sound sense of what he said, and from that
moment have been taking a less unfavourable
view of him. Indeed, it seems to me that I
was unjust to him in my partiality for his
brother. I exaggerated Jim&#8217;s impudence into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
courage, Walter&#8217;s diplomacy into cringing
cowardice. This is another illustration of how
careful a man should be not to let his hopes
and desires blind him. I had been refusing
to see what a wretched, untrustworthy scoundrel
James was, all because I wished my elder
son and namesake to be my principal heir and
had made up my mind that he must be worthy
of the honour.</p>

<p>There was only one point left unguarded&mdash;lest
his mother should, in her weakness for her
first-born, secretly supply him with money. I
might have been powerless to prevent this,
though I had determined to take from her all
power over the domestic expenditures and put
it in the hands of Burridge, in order that she
might have as few spare dollars as possible.
I knew I could count on her not sacrificing
her personal vanity to keep him in funds. But
with characteristic folly James shut his one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
door upon himself and spared me the trouble
of watching his mother.</p>

<p>She came to town Thursday last and sent
for me. I went up to the house for luncheon
with her. As soon as she heard that I was
there she joined me in the library. Her face
was stern and hard. &#8220;Read this,&#8221; she said,
handing me a letter. It was in James&#8217;s handwriting:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Mother dear</i>: You don&#8217;t know Theodora, or you
couldn&#8217;t have written what you did about her. You
will love her&mdash;no one can help loving her who knows
her. We were married this morning. When will you
come and let me show her what a beautiful, good
mother I have? I know you&#8217;ll come as soon as ever
you can.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Jim.</span></p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Theodora?&#8221; I said&mdash;I couldn&#8217;t imagine
whom he had induced to share his poverty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Theodora Glendenning,&#8221; she replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;The miserable boy!&#8221; I exclaimed, forgetting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
for an instant that he is nothing to me.
Theodora Glendenning was a widow, an adventuress
from heaven knows where. She had
obtained a slight footing in fairly good New
York society a few years before, as a young
girl, and had been invited to one or two first-class
houses. She was good-looking, had the
ways and voice of a siren, and a certain plausible
sweetness and gentleness. She trapped
young Nick Glendenning. His family
promptly cast him off and they sank into
obscurity, living on the income of the few
hundred thousands he had inherited from a
grandaunt. Then he died. We did not know
where or how James met her.</p>

<p>&#8220;He wrote me on Tuesday,&#8221; said my wife,
&#8220;that he&#8217;d been engaged to Theodora for six
months. It is infamous. I wrote him that, if
he sacrificed all his chances for position and
recognition in New York by marrying an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
adventuress, he needn&#8217;t expect me to do anything
for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you realise that I knew what I was
about when I shook him off,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, James. And after all the care I gave
him, after all I did for him! To defy me, to
trample on my love, and marry that worthless
nobody with her beggarly income! I had arranged
for him to marry Natalie Bradish.
She&#8217;d have helped us with her splendid
family.&#8221;</p>

<p>I smiled. &#8220;She wouldn&#8217;t have had him, my
dear,&#8221; I said; &#8220;she will marry Walter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;she would have married James. She
was crazy about him.&#8221;</p>

<p>This amazed me&mdash;women are always thinking
each other sentimental, yet every woman
ought to know that at bottom all women are
sensible and never take their eyes off the main
chance. But I said nothing. I was too well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
content with matters as they stood. Women
are so perverse that had I joined her just then
in attacking James she might have veered
round to him again on impulse.</p>

<p>Now that he has thwarted her ambitions for
him, and for herself through him, she will be
bitter in her hate where I shall be calm in mine.
She had her whole heart in the social strength
she was to gain by his making a brilliant marriage.
He has crushed her heart, has killed
the affection she had for him. She would
have forgiven him anything but a wife offensive
to her.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t altogether like the idea of this sort
of mother love. Men should be just; but
women should be merciful and loving. New
York and wealth and the social struggle have
made her too hard. However, I&#8217;m not quarrelling
seriously with what works so admirably
for my purpose as to James. Our common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
disaster in him will draw us nearer together
than we have been for years&mdash;at least until
the next wrangle over an expense account.
For years we have had opposite interests&mdash;I,
to restrain her; she, to outwit me. Now we
again have a common interest, and it is common
interest that makes husband and wife live
together in harmonious peace.</p>

<p>Nothing happens with me as with ordinary
human beings. What could be stranger than
that my new era of domestic quiet should be
founded, not upon love or affection or feelings
of that sort, but upon hate&mdash;upon my
and her common hate for our unworthy elder
son?</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">III</h2>
</div>


<p>It has been two years and five months since
I expelled James, yet my dissatisfaction with
Walter has not decreased.</p>

<p>No doubt this is due in part to the grudge
a man of my age who loves power and wealth
must have against the impatient waiter for his
throne and sceptre. No doubt, also, age and
long familiarity with power have made me,
perhaps, too critical of my fellow-beings and
too sensitive to their shortcomings. But, after
all allowances, I have real ground for my feeling
toward Walter.</p>

<p>My principal heir and successor, who is to
sustain my dignity after I am gone, and to
maintain my name in the exalted position to
which my wealth and genius have raised it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
should have, above all else, two qualifications&mdash;character
and an air of distinction.</p>

<p>Walter has neither.</p>

<p>My wife defends him for his lack of distinction
in manner and look by saying that I
have crushed him. &#8220;How could he have the
distinction you wish,&#8221; she says, &#8220;when he has
grown in the shadow of such a big, masterful,
intolerant personality as yours?&#8221; There is
justice in this. I admire distinction, or individuality,
but at a distance. I cannot tolerate
it in my immediate neighbourhood. There it
tempts me to crush it. I suspect that it would
have exasperated me even in one of my own
flesh and blood. Indeed, at bottom, that may
have had something to do with the beginnings
of my break with James.</p>

<p>But whatever excuse there may be for Walter&#8217;s
shifty, smirking, deprecating personality,
which seems to me, at times, not a peg above<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
the personality of a dancing-master, there is
no excuse whatsoever for his lack of character.</p>

<p>I rarely talk to him so long as ten minutes
without catching him in a lie&mdash;usually a silly
lie, about nothing at all. In money matters
he is not sensibly prudent, but downright miserly.
That is not an unnatural quality in age,
for then the time for setting the house in
order is short. An avaricious young man is a
monstrosity. I suppose that avarice is almost
inseparable from great wealth, or even from
the expectation of inheriting it. Just as
power makes a man greedy of power, so riches
make a man greedy of riches. But, granting
that Walter has to be avaricious, why hasn&#8217;t
he the wit to conceal it? It gives me no pleasure,
nowadays, to give; in fact, it makes me
suffer to see anything going out, unless I know
it is soon to return bringing a harvest after its
kind. Yet, I give&mdash;at least, I have given, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
that liberally. Walter need not have made
himself so noted and disliked for stinginess
that he has been able to get into only one of
the three fashionable clubs I wished him to
join&mdash;and that one the least desirable.</p>

<p>His mother says he was excluded because
the best people of our class resent my having
elbowed and trampled my way into power too
vigorously, and with too few &#8220;beg pardons,&#8221;
and &#8220;if you pleases.&#8221; Perhaps my courage
in taking my own frankly wherever I found it
may have made his admission difficult, just as
it has made our social progress slow. But it
would not have excluded him&mdash;would not have
made him patently unpopular where my
money and the fear of me gains him toleration.
A very few dollars judiciously spent
would have earned him the reputation of a
good fellow, generous and free-handed.</p>

<p>Your poor chap has to fling away everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
he&#8217;s got to get that name, but a rich man
can get it for what, to him, is a trifle. By
means of a smile or a dinner I&#8217;d have to pay
for anyhow, or perhaps by allowing him to
ride a few blocks beside me in my brougham
or victoria, I send a grumbler away trumpeting
my praises. I throw an industry into confusion
to get possession of it, and then I give
a twentieth of the profits to some charity or
college; instead of a chorus of curses, I get
praise, or, at worst, silence. The public lays
what it is pleased to call the &#8220;crime&#8221; upon the
corporation I own; the benefaction is credited
to me personally.</p>

<p>Nor has Walter the excuse for his lying and
shifting and other moral lapses that a man
who is making his way could plead.</p>

<p>I did many things in my early days which
I&#8217;d scorn to do now. I did them only because
they were necessary to my purpose. Walter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
has not the slightest provocation. When his
mother says, &#8220;But he does those things because
he&#8217;s afraid of you,&#8221; she talks nonsense.
The truth is that he has a moral twist. It is
one thing for a clear-sighted man of high
purpose and great firmness, like myself, to
adopt indirect measures as a temporary and
desperate expedient; it&#8217;s vastly different for
a Walter, with everything provided for him,
to resort to such measures voluntarily and
habitually.</p>

<p>Sometimes I think he must have been created
during one of my periods of advance by
ambuscade.</p>

<p>How ridiculous to fall out with honesty and
truth when there&#8217;s any possible way of avoiding
it! To do so is to use one&#8217;s last reserves
at the beginning of a battle instead of at the
crisis.</p>

<p>However, it&#8217;s Walter or nobody. I cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
abandon my life&#8217;s ambition, the perpetuation
of my fortune and fame in a family line.
Next to its shortness, life&#8217;s greatest tragedy
for men of my kind is the wretched tools with
which we must work. All my days I&#8217;ve been
a giant, doing a giant&#8217;s work with a pygmy&#8217;s
puny tools. Now, with the end&mdash;no, not near,
but not so far away as it was&mdash;</p>

<p>Just as I got home from the Chamber of
Commerce dinner two weeks ago to-night, my
wife was coming down to go to Mrs. Garretson&#8217;s
ball. The great hall of my house, with
its costly tapestries and carpets and statuary,
is a source of keen pleasure to me. I don&#8217;t
think I ever enter it, except when I&#8217;m much
preoccupied, that I don&#8217;t look round and draw
in some such satisfaction as a toper gets from
a brimming glass of whiskey. But, for that
matter, all the luxuries and comforts which
wealth gives me are a steady source of gratification.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
The children of a man who rose
from poverty to wealth may possibly&mdash;I
doubt it&mdash;have the physical gratification in
wealth blunted. But the man who does the
rising has it as keen on the last day of healthy
life as on the first day he became the owner of
a carriage with somebody in his livery to drive
him.</p>

<p>As my wife came down the wide marble
stairs the great hall became splendid. I had
to stop and admire her, or, rather, the way she
shone and sparkled and blazed, becapped and
bedecked and bedraped with jewels as she
was. I have an eye that sees everything;
that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m accused of being ferociously
critical. I saw that there was something incongruous
in her appearance&mdash;something that
jarred. A second glance showed me that it
was the contrast between her rubies and diamonds,
in bands, in clusters, and in ropes, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
her fading physical charms. She is not altogether
faded yet&mdash;she is fifty to my sixty-four&mdash;and
she has been for years spending several
hours a day with <i>masseuses</i>, complexion-specialists,
hair-doctors, and others of that kind.
But she has reached the age where, in spite of
doctoring and dieting and deception, there are
many and plain signs of that double tragedy
of a handsome, vain woman&#8217;s life&mdash;on the one
hand, the desperate fight to make youth remain;
on the other hand, the desperate fight
to hide from the world the fact that it is about
to depart for ever.</p>

<p>Naturally it depressed me that I could no
longer think with pride of her beauty, and of
how it was setting off my wealth. I must
have shown what I was thinking, for she
looked at me, first with anxious inquiry, then
with frightened suspicion, as if guessing my
thoughts.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>Poor woman! I felt sorry for her.</p>

<p>Her life, for the past twenty years, has been
based wholly on vanity. The look in my face
told her, perhaps a few weeks earlier than she
would have learned it from her mirror or some
malicious bosom friend, that the basis of her
life was swept away, and that her happiness
was ended. She hurried past me, spoke savagely
to the four men-servants who were
jostling one another in trying to help her to
her carriage, and drove away in her grandeur
to the ball, probably as miserable a creature
as there was on Manhattan Island that night.</p>

<p>I went up to my apartment, half depressed,
half amused&mdash;I have too keen a sense of humour
not to be amused whenever I see vanity
take a tumble. As I reached my sitting-room
I was in the full swing of my moralisings on
the physical vanity of women, and on their
silliness in setting store by their beauty after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
it has served its sole, legitimate, really useful
purpose&mdash;has caught them husbands. Only
mischief can come of beauty in a married
woman. She should give it up, retire to her
home, and remain there until it is time for her
to bring out and marry off her grown sons
and daughters. If my wife hadn&#8217;t been handsome
she might have done this, and so might
have continued to shine in her proper sphere&mdash;the
care of her household and her children,
the comfort of her husband.</p>

<p>As I reached this point in my moralisings
I caught sight of my own face by the powerful
light over my shaving glass.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve never taken any great amount of interest
in my face, or anybody else&#8217;s. I&#8217;ve no
belief in the theory that you can learn much
from your adversary&#8217;s expression. In a sense,
the face is the map of the mind. But the map
has so many omissions and mismarkings, all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
at important points, that time spent in studying
it is time wasted. My plan has been to go
straight along my own line, without bothering
my head about the other fellow&#8217;s plans&mdash;much
less about his looks. I think my millions
prove me right.</p>

<p>As I was saying, I saw my face&mdash;suddenly,
with startling clearness, and when my mind
was on the subject of faces. The sight gave
me a shock&mdash;not because my expression was
sardonic and&mdash;yes, I shall confess it&mdash;cruel
and bitterly unhappy. The shock came in
that, before I recognised myself, I had said,
&#8220;Who is this <i>old</i> man?&#8221;</p>

<p>The glass reflected wrinkles, bags, creases,
hollows&mdash;signs of the old age of a hard, fierce
life.</p>

<p>Curiously, my first comment on myself,
seen as others saw me, was a stab into my
physical vanity&mdash;not a very deep stab, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
deep enough to mock my self-complacent
jeers at my wife. Then I went on to wonder
why I had not before understood the reason
for many things I&#8217;ve done of late.</p>

<p>For example, I hadn&#8217;t realised why I put
five hundred thousand dollars into a mausoleum.
I did it without the faintest notion that
my instinctive self was saying, &#8220;You&#8217;d better
see to it at once that you&#8217;ll be fittingly housed&mdash;some
day.&#8221; Again, I hadn&#8217;t understood
why it was becoming so hard for me to persuade
myself to keep up my public gifts.</p>

<p>I have always seen that for us men of great
wealth gifts are not merely a wise, but a vitally
necessary, investment.</p>

<p>Jack Ridley insists that I exaggerate the
envy the lower classes feel for us. &#8220;You rich
men think others are like yourselves,&#8221; he says.
&#8220;Because all your thoughts are of money, you
fancy the rest of the world is equally narrow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
and spends most of its time in hating you and
plotting against you. Why, the fact is that
rich men envy one another more than the poor
envy them.&#8221; There&#8217;s some truth in this. The
fellow with one million enviously hates the
fellow with ten; as for most fellows with
twenty or thirty, they can hardly bear to hear
the fellows with fifty or sixty spoken of. But,
in the main, Jack is wrong. I&#8217;ve not forgotten
how I used to feel when I had a few hundred
a year; and so I know what&#8217;s going on
in the heads of people when they bow and
scrape and speak softly, as they do to me. It
means that they&#8217;re envying and are only too
eager to find an excuse for hating. They
want me to think that they like me.</p>

<p>I used to give chiefly because I liked the
fame it brought me&mdash;also, a little, because it
made me feel that I was balancing my rather
ruthless financial methods by doing vast good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
with what many would have kept selfishly to
the last penny. Latterly my chief motive has
been more substantial; and I wonder how I
could have let wealth-hunger so blind me, as
it has in the past four or five years, that I have
haggled over and cut my public gifts.</p>

<p>The very day after I saw my face in the
mirror I definitely committed myself to my
long tentatively promised gift of an additional
four millions to the university which bears my
name. I also arranged to get those four millions&mdash;but
that comes later. Finally, I began
to hasten my son Walter&#8217;s marriage to Natalie
Bradish.</p>

<p>My son Walter!</p>

<p>It certainly isn&#8217;t lack of shrewdness that
unfits him to be head of the family. Why do
the qualities we most admire in ourselves, and
find most useful there, so often irritate and
even disgust us in another?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>I have not told him that he is already the
principal heir under the terms of my will.
He will work harder to please me so long as
he thinks the prize still withheld&mdash;still to be
earned. He does not know how firmly my
mind is set against James. So he never loses
an opportunity to clinch my purpose. One
day last week, in presence of his sister
Aurora, I was reproving him for one of his
many shortcomings, and, to enforce my reproof,
was warning him that such conduct did
not advance him toward the place from which
his brother had been deposed.</p>

<p>His upper lip always twitches when he is
about to launch one of those bits of craftiness
he thinks so profound. The longer I live, the
deeper is my contempt for craft&mdash;it so rarely
fails to tangle and strangle itself in its own
unwieldy nets. After his lip had twitched
awhile, he looked furtively at Aurora. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
looked also, and saw that she was a partner
in his scheme, whatever it was.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; said I, impatiently, &#8220;what is it?
Speak out!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You spoke of the position James lost,&#8221; he
forced himself to say; &#8220;there wasn&#8217;t any such
place, was there, Aurora?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered; &#8220;James was deceiving
you right along.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; I demanded.</p>

<p>Aurora looked nervously at Walter, and he
said: &#8220;James often used to talk to us about
your plans, and he always said that he
wouldn&#8217;t let you make him your principal
heir. He said he would disregard your will
and would just divide the money up, giving
a third to mother and making all us children
equal heirs with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is amazing how the most astute man will
overlook the simplest and plainest dangers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
In all my thinking and planning on the subject
of founding a family. I had never
once thought of the possibility of my will
being voluntarily broken by its chief beneficiary.</p>

<p>&#8220;What reason did he give?&#8221; I asked, for I
could conceive no reason whatsoever.</p>

<p>Aurora and Walter were silent. Walter
looked as if he wished he had not launched his
torpedo at James.</p>

<p>&#8220;What reason, Aurora?&#8221; I insisted.</p>

<p>She flushed and stammered: &#8220;He said he&mdash;he
didn&#8217;t want to be hated by mother and the
rest of us. He said we&#8217;d have the right to
hate him, and couldn&#8217;t help it if he should be
low enough to profit by your&mdash;your&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My&mdash;what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your heartlessness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And do you think my plan was heartless?&#8221;
I asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Aurora, but I saw that she
thought &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve a right to do as you wish with your
own,&#8221; said Walter. &#8220;We know you&#8217;ll do what
is for the best interest of us all. Even if you
should leave us nothing, we&#8217;d still be in your
debt. You owe us nothing, father. We owe
you everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although this was simply a statement of a
truth which I hold to be fundamental, it irritated
me to hear him say it. I know too well
what havoc self-interest works in the sense of
right and wrong, and Walter would be the
first of my children to insult my memory if
he were to get less by a penny than any other
of the family. Had I been concerning myself
about what my wife and my children would
think of me after I was gone, I should never
have entertained the idea of founding a family.
But men of large view and large wealth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
and large ambition do not heed these minor
matters. When it comes to human beings,
they deal in generals, not in particulars.</p>

<p>A fine world we should have if the masters
of it consulted the feelings of those whom destiny
compels them to use or to discard.</p>

<p>I looked at this precious pair of plotters
satirically. &#8220;Naturally,&#8221; said I, &#8220;you never
spoke to me of James&#8217;s purpose so long as
there was a chance of your profiting by his
intended treachery to me.&#8221; Then to Aurora I
added: &#8220;I understand now why, for several
months after James left, you persisted in begging
me to take him back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aurora burst into tears. As tears irritate
me, I left the room. Thinking over the scandalous
exhibition of cupidity which these children
of mine had given, I was almost tempted
to tear up my will and make a new one creating
a vast public institution that would bear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
my name, and endowing it with the bulk of
my wealth. I have often wondered why an
occasional man of great wealth has done this.
I now have no doubt that usually it has been
because he was disgusted by the revolting
greediness of his natural heirs. If rich men
should generally adopt this course, I suspect
their funerals would have less of the air of
sunshine bursting through black clouds&mdash;it&#8217;s
particularly noticeable in the carriages immediately
behind the hearse.</p>

<p>Jack Ridley says my sense of humour is like
an Apache&#8217;s. Perhaps that&#8217;s why the idea of
a posthumous joke of this kind tickles me
immensely. Were I not a serious man, with
serious purposes in the world, I might perpetrate
it.</p>

<p>The net result of Walter and Aurora&#8217;s
effort to advance themselves&mdash;I wonder what
Walter promised Aurora that induced her to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
aid him?&mdash;was that I formed a new plan. I
resolved that Walter should marry at once.
As soon as he has a male child I shall make a
new will leaving it the bulk of my estate, and
giving Walter only the control of the income
for life&mdash;or until the child shall have become
a man thirty years old.</p>

<p>That evening I ordered him to arrange
with Natalie for a wedding within two
months. I knew he would see her at the
opera, as my wife had invited her to my box.
I intended to ask him in the morning what he
and she had settled upon, but before I had a
chance I saw in my paper a piece of news that
put him and her out of my mind for the
moment.</p>

<p>James, so the paper said, was critically ill
with pneumonia at his house in East Sixty-third
Street, near Fifth Avenue. He has
lived there ever since he was married, and has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
kept up a considerable establishment. I am
certain that his wife&#8217;s dresses and entertainments
are part of the cause of my wife&#8217;s rapid
aging. Really, her hatred of that woman
amounts to insanity. It amazes me, used as
I am to the irrational emotions of women. I
could understand her being exasperated by the
social success of James and his wife. I confess
that it has exasperated me&mdash;almost as
much as has his preposterous luck in Wall
Street. But there is undeniably a better explanation
than luck for his and her social success.
They say she has beauty and charm, and
her entertainments show originality and talent,
while my wife&#8217;s are commonplace and dull, in
spite of the money she lavishes. But, in addition
to those reasons, there are many of the
upper-class people who hate me. Mine is a
pretty big omelet; there is a lot of eggs in it;
and, with every broken egg, somebody, usually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
somebody high up, felt robbed or
cheated.</p>

<p>But I did not trust to my wife&#8217;s insane hate
for James&#8217;s wife to keep her away from her
son in his illness. I went straight to her. &#8220;I
see that James is ill, or pretends to be,&#8221; I said.
&#8220;Probably he and his wife are plotting a
reconciliation.&#8221;</p>

<p>My wife has learned to mask her feelings
behind a cold, expressionless face; but she has
also learned to obey me. She often threatens,
but she dares not act. I know it&mdash;and she
knows that I know it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not go to him under any circumstances,&#8221;
I went on&mdash;&#8220;neither you nor any of
the rest of us. If you disobey, I shall at once
rearrange my domestic finances. Thereafter
you will go to Burridge for money whenever
you want to buy so much as a paper of
pins.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>She was white&mdash;perhaps with fury, perhaps
with dread, perhaps with both. I said no
more, but left her as soon as I saw that she
did not intend to reply. Toward six o&#8217;clock
that evening I met Walter in the main hall of
the first bedroom floor. He was for hurrying
by me, but I stopped him. I have an instinct
which tells me unerringly when to ask a question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>He shifted from leg to leg; he, like most
people, is never quite at ease in my presence;
when he is trying to conceal some specific
thing from me he becomes a victim of a sort
of suppressed hysteria. &#8220;To the drawing-room,&#8221;
he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>He shivered, then blurted it out: &#8220;James&#8217;s
wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you tell me in the first place?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>He stammered: &#8220;I&mdash;wished to&mdash;to spare
you&mdash;the&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah!&#8221; I interrupted. As if I could not
read in his face that her coming had roused
his fears of a reconciliation with James!
&#8220;What are you going to say to her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A message from mother,&#8221; he muttered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you seen your mother, or did you
make up the message?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A servant brought mother her card and a
note. I didn&#8217;t know she was in the house till
mother sent for me and gave me the message
to take down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will your mother see her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed,&#8221; he replied, recovered somewhat;
&#8220;mother won&#8217;t have anything to do with
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, go on and deliver your message,&#8221; I
said; &#8220;I&#8217;ll step into the little reception-room
behind the drawing-room. See that you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
speak loud enough for me to hear every
word.&#8221;</p>

<p>As I entered the reception-room, he entered
the drawing-room. &#8220;Mother says,&#8221; he said&mdash;naturally,
his voice was ridiculously loud and
nervous&mdash;&#8220;that she has no interest in the information
you sent her, and no acquaintance
with the person to whom it relates.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a silence so long that curiosity
made me move within range of one of the
long drawing-room mirrors. I saw her and
Walter reflected, facing each other. She was
so stationed that I had a plain view of her
whole figure and of her face&mdash;the first time
I had ever really seen her face. Her figure
was drawn to its full height, and her bosom
was rising and falling rapidly. Her head
was thrown back, and upon poor Walter was
beating the most contemptuous expression I
ever saw coming from human eyes. No wonder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
even his back showed how wilted and weak
he was.</p>

<p>As I watched, she suddenly turned her
eyes; her glance met mine in the mirror. Before
I could recover and completely drive the
look of amusement from my face, she had
waved Walter aside and was standing in front
of me. &#8220;You heard what your son said!&#8221; she
exclaimed; &#8220;what do <i>you</i> say?&#8221;</p>

<p>I liked her looks, and especially liked her
voice. It was clear. It was magnetic. It
was honest. When I wish to separate sheep
from goats I listen to their voices, for voices
do not often lie.</p>

<p>&#8220;I refuse to believe that he delivered my
note to&mdash;to James&#8217;s mother.&#8221; There was a
break in her voice as she spoke James&#8217;s name&mdash;it
distinctly made my nerves tingle, unmoved
though my mind was. &#8220;James is&mdash;is&mdash;&#8221;
she went on, slowly, but not unsteadily&mdash;&#8220;the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
doctors say there&#8217;s no hope. And he&mdash;your
son&mdash;sent me, and I am here when&mdash;when&mdash;but&mdash;what
do <i>you</i> say?&#8221;</p>

<p>It is extraordinary what power there is in
that woman&#8217;s personality. If Walter hadn&#8217;t
been there I might have had to lash myself
into a fury and insult her to save myself from
being swept away. As it was, I looked at her
steadily, then rang the bell. The servant
came.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show this lady out,&#8221; I said, and I bowed
and went to Walter in the drawing-room. I
can only imagine how she must have felt.
Nothing frenzies a woman&mdash;or a man&mdash;so
wildly as to be sent away from a &#8220;scene&#8221; without
a single insult given to gloat over or a
single insult received to bite on.</p>

<p>The morning paper confirmed her statement
of James&#8217;s condition. In fact, I didn&#8217;t
have to wait until then, for toward twelve that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
night I heard the boys in the street bellowing
an &#8220;extra&#8221; about him&mdash;that he was dying, and
that none of his family had visited him.
Those whose sense of justice is clouded by
their feelings will be unable to understand
why I felt no inclination to yield. Indeed, I
do not expect to be understood in this except
by those of my class&mdash;the men whose large
responsibilities and duties have forced them to
put wholly aside those feelings in which the
ordinary run of mankind may indulge without
harm. I don&#8217;t deny that I had qualms. I
can sympathise now with those kings and
great men who have been forced to order
their sons to death. And I have charged
against James the pangs he then caused
me.</p>

<p>In the superficial view it may seem inconsistent
that, while I stood firm, I was shocked
by my wife&#8217;s insensibility. I had to do my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
duty, but she should have found it impossible
to do hers. I could not, of course, rebuke her
and Aurora for not transgressing my orders;
but all that night and all the next day I wondered
at their hardness, their unwomanliness.
It seemed to me another illustration of the
painful side of wealth and position&mdash;their demoralising
effect upon women.</p>

<p>The late afternoon papers announced&mdash;truthfully&mdash;a
favourable change in James&#8217;s
condition. In defiance of the doctors&#8217; decree
of death, he had rallied. &#8220;It is that wife of
his,&#8221; I said to myself. &#8220;Such a personality is
a match for death itself.&#8221; I had a sense of
huge relief. Indeed, it was not until I knew
James wasn&#8217;t going to die that I realised how
hard a fight my parental instinct had made
against duty.</p>

<p>If I had liked Walter better I should not
have been thus weak about James.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>When I reached home and was about to
undress for my bath and evening change,
my daughter Helen knocked and entered.
&#8220;Well?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>She stood before me, tall and slim and
golden brown&mdash;the colour is chiefly in her hair
and lashes and brows, but there is a golden
brown tinge in her skin; as for her eyes, they
are more gold than brown, I think. Her dress
reaches to her shoe-tops. With her hands
clasped in front of her, she fixed her large,
serious eyes upon me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I went to see James this morning,&#8221; she
said; then seemed to be waiting&mdash;not in fear,
but in courage&mdash;for my vengeance to descend.</p>

<p>I scowled and turned away to hide the
satisfaction this gave me. At least there
is one female in my family with a woman&#8217;s
heart!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>&#8220;Who put you up to it?&#8221; I demanded,
sharply.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_118.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;<i>&#8216;Not to have told you would have been a lie.&#8217;</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody. I heard the boys calling in the
street&mdash;and&mdash;I went.&#8221;</p>

<p>I turned upon her and looked at her narrowly.
&#8220;Why do you tell me?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because not to have told you would have
been a lie.&#8221;</p>

<p>She said this quite simply. I had never
been so astonished before in my life. &#8220;And
what of that?&#8221; said I&mdash;a shameful question
under the circumstances to put to a child; but
I was completely off my guard, and I couldn&#8217;t
believe there was not an underlying motive of
practical gain.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not care to lie,&#8221; she answered, her eyes
upon mine. I found her look hard to withstand&mdash;a
new experience for me, as I can
usually compel any one&#8217;s gaze to shift.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a good child,&#8221; said I, patting her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
on the shoulder. &#8220;I shall not punish you this
time. You may go.&#8221;</p>

<p>She flushed to the line of her hair, and her
eyes blazed. She drew herself away from my
hand and left me staring after her, more astonished
than before.</p>

<p>A strange person&mdash;surely, a personality!
She will be troublesome some day&mdash;soon.</p>

<p>With such beauty and such fine presence she
ought to make a magnificent marriage.</p>

<p>I was free to take up Walter and Natalie
again. After dinner I said to him, as we sat
smoking: &#8220;Have you spoken to Natalie?
What does she say? What date did you settle
upon?&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked sheepishly from Burridge to
Ridley, then appealingly at me. I laughed at
this affectation of delicacy, but I humoured
him by sending them away. &#8220;What date?&#8221; I
repeated.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>He twitched more than usual before he succeeded
in saying: &#8220;She refuses to decide just
yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; I demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;She says she doesn&#8217;t want to settle down
so young.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Young!&#8221; I exclaimed. &#8220;Why, she&#8217;s twenty-one&mdash;out
three seasons. What&#8217;s the matter
with you, that you haven&#8217;t got her half frightened
to death lest she&#8217;ll lose you?&#8221; With all
he has to offer through being my son and my
principal heir he ought to be able to settle
the marriage on his own terms in every respect&mdash;and
to keep the whip for ever afterward.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he replied; &#8220;she just won&#8217;t.
I don&#8217;t think she cares much about&mdash;about the
marriage.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was too feeble and foolish to answer.
There isn&#8217;t a more sensible, better-brought-up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
girl in New York than Natalie. Her mother
began training her in the cradle to look forward
to being mistress of a great fortune. I
knew she, and her mother and father too, had
fixed on mine as <i>the</i> fortune as long ago as
five years&mdash;she was only sixteen when I myself
noted her making eyes at Jim and never
losing a chance to ingratiate herself with me.
Her temporising with Walter convinced me
there was something wrong&mdash;and I suspected
what. I went to see her, and got her to take
a drive with me.</p>

<p>As my victoria entered the Park I began:
&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Natalie? Why won&#8217;t
you &#8216;name the day&#8217;? We&#8217;re old friends. You
can talk to me as freely as to your own
father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; she replied; &#8220;you&#8217;ve always
been <i>so</i> good to me&mdash;and you are <i>so</i> kind and
generous.&#8221; There isn&#8217;t a better manner anywhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
than Natalie&#8217;s. She has a character as
strong and fine as her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m getting old,&#8221; I went on, &#8220;and I want
to see my boy settled. I want to see you my
daughter, ready to take up your duties as head
of my house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try to hurry me,&#8221; she said, a trace
of irritation in her voice. &#8220;I&#8217;m only twenty-one.
I wish to have a little pleasure before
I become as serious as I&#8217;ll have to be when I&#8217;m&mdash;your
daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>I noticed that she pointedly avoided saying
&#8220;Walter&#8217;s wife.&#8221; This confirmed my suspicion.
The habit of judging everything and
everybody calmly and dispassionately has
made me see the members of my own family
just as I see outsiders. And I couldn&#8217;t blame
her for balking at Walter, exasperating
though it was to have her thus impede my
plans.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>&#8220;Is there anything wrong, Natalie?&#8221; I
asked, gently. &#8220;Speak frankly to me&mdash;perhaps
I can smooth it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you!&#8221; she exclaimed. It&#8217;s really
delightful to see a person who can be warmhearted,
yet stop short of indiscreet and dangerous
sentimentality. &#8220;But,&#8221; she went on,
&#8220;how can I tell <i>you</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it Walter?&#8221; I asked, with a smile that
invited confidence and guaranteed sympathy.</p>

<p>She was silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has he been disagreeable to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&mdash;he&#8217;s kindness itself. But&mdash;I
don&#8217;t know&mdash;I simply can&#8217;t make up my mind
to marry.&#8221;</p>

<p>She didn&#8217;t add &#8220;him,&#8221; but she let me see
that she meant it. I saw the struggle that had
been going on in her mind. She did not like
him, to put it mildly. She longed to give him
up. Every time she thought of him she felt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
that she must. Every time she thought of
me and my fortune, and the position I
would give my son&#8217;s wife, she felt that she
couldn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you talked with your mother about
this?&#8221; I knew what a clear-headed, far-sighted
woman Matt Bradish&#8217;s wife was&mdash;she&#8217;s
married off three children, all splendidly,
not to speak of her catching Matt.</p>

<p>&#8220;If she doesn&#8217;t stop nagging me she&#8217;ll drive
me to marry&mdash;somebody else,&#8221; said Natalie,
her voice trembling with anger. &#8220;I&#8217;ll kick the
traces, sure as fate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m sure you don&#8217;t care for this somebody
else,&#8221; I said, positively. I knew the chap&mdash;a
painter. I can&#8217;t conceive why people of
our sort permit youths of that kind to roam
among their marriageable daughters. Even a
sensible, well-trained girl, with all youth&#8217;s disdain
of poverty and adoration of wealth, has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
her foolish moments like the rest of us. &#8220;I&#8217;m
sure you don&#8217;t,&#8221; I repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;But at least I don&#8217;t&mdash;don&#8217;t&mdash;<i>dislike</i> him.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was thoroughly alarmed. I saw that she
was actually trying to goad me into anger
against her; that she was riding for a fall;
wished to force herself into a position where
marriage with Walter would be made impossible.
The poor child hadn&#8217;t the heart to refuse
the prize which she lacked the stomach to
take; she wished to make me snatch it from
her. But the Bradish connection is far too
important to my plans. I haven&#8217;t had my
hand on my temper-rein for forty years without
being able to control my feelings&mdash;when
I wish. Besides, it was Walter that she practically
said she disliked; and I can see how she
might&mdash;I certainly shouldn&#8217;t love him if it
were not my duty to do so.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got your choice, my child,&#8221; said I,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
&#8220;of being married for your money or of marrying
into as enviable a position as there is in
New York. I <i>know</i> you&#8217;re too sensible to let
trifles obscure your judgment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I simply <i>won&#8217;t</i> be driven!&#8221; she retorted.
&#8220;Why should I bother? I&#8217;ve got a little something
in my own right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just enough to make you realise the possibilities
of wealth,&#8221; I replied&mdash;&#8220;just enough to
spur your ambition.&#8221; I began to watch her
face keenly. &#8220;And you sha&#8217;n&#8217;t have to wait
for your triumph,&#8221; I said, and I made an impressive
pause before I slowly added: &#8220;I&#8217;m
going to settle an annual income of a quarter
of a million on you for life.&#8221;</p>

<p>I saw her face soften. The colour came and
went in her delicate skin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have tested you, Natalie,&#8221; I went on.
&#8220;I know you are the woman I want as my
daughter. It will make me happy to see you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
outshining them all, as you will. And I&#8217;ll
make you absolutely independent of Walter&mdash;of
me, even.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was looking at me with glistening eyes.
I saw that I had thrilled her through and
through. Profoundly to move a human being,
one must touch his or her deepest passion&mdash;his
or her particular form of vanity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you, Natalie?&#8221; I pleaded, &#8220;won&#8217;t
you make me happy? Won&#8217;t you let me give
you what your beauty and refinement demand?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at me sweetly&mdash;a look of surrender.</p>

<p>I knew I had won. Then her eyes were
twinkling, and instantly I grasped the reason.
We both burst out laughing. It certainly was
amusing&mdash;a father wooing and winning for
his son where all his son&#8217;s efforts had made his
cause only more hopeless. And throughout,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
what a quaint reversal of old-established, generally
accepted ideas of love and marriage!
But&mdash;&#8220;Other times, other customs!&#8221;</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_128.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;<i>&#8216;You will marry on the sixteenth of April, at noon. Get<br />
yourself ready.&#8217;</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>I dropped Natalie at Mrs. Kirkby&#8217;s and
went back to my study. I rang the bell and
sent the answering servant for Walter. Presently
I looked up from my work&mdash;he was
standing before me, shifting his eyes from
point to point, his body from leg to leg.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will marry on the sixteenth of April,
at noon,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Get yourself ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>And I dismissed him with a wave of my
hand.</p>

<p>It would be sheer madness for me to keep
my apparent promise, made, in the heat of my
earnestness, merely to save Natalie from her
own folly, and therefore not really binding.
To give her a quarter of a million a year absolutely
and for life would be to invite disaster&mdash;no,
to compel it. She&#8217;d be in the divorce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
courts ridding herself of Walter within two
years.</p>

<p>She shall have the substance of my promise&mdash;I
shall do everything for her. But she must
not have the mere letter, which would injure
her, would tempt her to wreck her life and my
plans and the future of her children. It was
wise to promise; it would be wrong to fulfil.
No, I must retain full control, must keep my
steadying hand firmly upon her. And, after
all, what did I pledge?</p>

<p>I was careful to phrase it delicately, for I&#8217;m
always extremely particular in my choice and
use of words at crucial moments. I was careful
to say, &#8220;an annual income of a quarter of
a million.&#8221; All turns upon the word &#8220;an&#8221;&mdash;if
it were &#8220;the,&#8221; my phrase would mean something
entirely different.</p>

<p>I shall settle two hundred and fifty thousand
on her on the day they marry&mdash;after the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
ceremony. I shall protest that a quarter of a
million in all was what I meant&mdash;and I certainly
did, though I don&#8217;t here deny that I
may have meant for her to think I meant a
quarter of a million a year. She will be&mdash;not
in what you would call a pleasant state of
mind. But what can she do? When she shall
have calmed down, she&#8217;ll probably give me the
benefit of the doubt, tell herself she misunderstood
me, rail at herself for her folly, and then&mdash;behave
herself.</p>

<p>True, she&#8217;s shrewd, and her parents, too.
They&#8217;ll try legally to commit me <i>before</i> the
wedding. But surely I can circumvent them.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s &#8220;a way out.&#8221; There <i>always</i> is!</p>

</div>


<p>It was necessary for me to find, calculating
liberally, about eight million dollars&mdash;the four
millions definitely promised to my university,
a quarter of a million to redeem my promise
to Natalie, a million properly to set Walter
and her going in an independent establishment,
two millions to provide them with the
income to maintain it, and about half a million
for my own and my family&#8217;s regular
annual expenses. Further, an investment of
twelve millions that had been sending its seven
per cent. securely and regularly for the past
nine years was about to fall in through the
payment of the debt it represented&mdash;I could
write a volume on the harassments and exasperations
of hunting investments. Finally, I
was hoping that Aurora would marry Horton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
Kirkby, which might mean a million, perhaps
several millions, more, if he should demand a
dowry.</p>

<p>The situation commanded me to plan and
carry through some new enterprise which
would afford me a safe investment for my released
twelve millions and in addition would
net me enough to cover well the other demands
upon me. Years ago&mdash;as soon as I had my
first million put by&mdash;I resolved that I would
never for any purpose whatsoever subtract a
penny either from the principal or from the
income of my fortune. Gifts of all kinds, expenses
of all kinds, outgo of every description,
must come from new sources of revenue; my
fortune and its income and the surplus over
the previous year&#8217;s outgo must be treated as
a sacred fund of which I was merely the trustee.
That rule has put me often in straits, has
forced me to many money-making measures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
that in the narrow view would be called relentless.
But to it the world owes my highest
achievements, as a financier and industrial
leader, and to it I owe the bulk of my fortune.</p>

<p>The brain earns in vain, however hugely, if
the hands do not hoard; and, thanks to my
rule, my hands have been like those valves
which open only to pressure from without and
seal the more tightly the greater the pressure
from within.</p>

<p>I could not break my rule. Yet I must
properly marry my children and must keep
my promise to my university; and to have left
twelve millions of capital idle would have been
to show myself unworthy of the responsibilities
of great wealth. I was thus literally
driven to one of those large public services
which are so venomously criticised by the small
and the envious. Every action of no matter
what kind produces both good and bad consequences.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
To wait until one could act without
any unfortunate results to anybody would be
to sit motionless, even to refrain from eating.
The most that conscience demands is that one
shall do only those things which in his best
judgment will show a balance on the side of
good.</p>

<p>I had long had my eye on certain mines and
appendant manufactories situated at several
points on two of my three lines of railway.
They were doing well enough in a small way;
but I knew that, combined under the direction
of such a brain as mine, they would become
immensely more profitable. I now saw no
alternative to taking them and making them as
valuable and as useful as they were clearly
intended to be. In preparation for the <i>coup</i> I
withdrew from the directory of my third
railway, substituting one of my unrecognised
agents, himself a millionaire in a small way;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
and I put my stock in the names of others of
my agents and did not deny the report that
I had ceased to have any financial interest in
the road. Thus I was in a position to alter its
freight rates without the change being traced
to me by those prying meddlers who are so
active in their interference in other people&#8217;s
business nowadays. When it was universally
believed that I no longer had any connection
with my third road, and that it had passed to
a control hostile to me, I ordered it to give
large secret rebates upon all freight of the
kind I wished to affect.</p>

<p>The result was that the owners of those
mines and factories, being compelled to ship
by my two other railways, which stiffly maintained
rates, were no longer able to compete.
Their competitors, shipping by my third line,
easily undersold them with the assistance of
the secret rebate. They came in a stew and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
sweat to my two presidents and said that secret
rebates by the third line were the cause of their
impending ruin. My two presidents agreed
with them and opened a fierce war of words
upon my third president&mdash;him whom they and
every one else thought hostile to me. He retorted
with a sweeping denial of their charges.
&#8220;It is nothing new in a world of self-excuse,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;for incompetent business men to
attribute their misfortunes to the wickedness
of others instead of to the real source&mdash;their
own incapacity and incompetence.&#8221; And so
the sham battle raged by mail and newspaper
interview. But&mdash;the mine and factory owners
I was gunning for got nothing tangible out
of it. Their competitors continued to undersell
them; their business rapidly languished.</p>

<p>When I saw that they were in a sufficiently
humble frame of mind I came to their relief.
I sent word to them that, as I had a warm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
personal feeling for the towns dependent
upon the prosperity of their works, I would
take a hand in their languishing businesses if
they wished and would do my utmost to maintain
the apparently hopeless battle.</p>

<p>My offer was received with enthusiastic
gratitude&mdash;as it should have been; for, while
it is true that I had precipitated the crisis
which their antiquated methods of doing business
would have inevitably brought sooner or
later, is it not also true that I have the right to
do what I wish with my own? And are not
those two railways, and the third, as well, my
own? But for the present rampant spirit of
contemptuous disregard for the rights of private
property and the impudent intrusions
into private business it would not have been
necessary for me to disguise myself and act
like a housebreaker in order to exercise my
plain rights&mdash;yes, and do my plain duty; for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
can there be any question in any judicial mind
that it is the duty of men of the commercial
and financial genius which I possess to use it
to bring the resources of the country to their
highest efficiency?</p>

<p>After some negotiations I got control of
the properties that I needed and that needed
me. I agreed to pay altogether fifteen millions
for a controlling share in them&mdash;about
half what it would have cost me before I
brought my rebate artillery to bear, but about
twice what control would have cost had I battered
away for six months longer. I might
have accomplished my purpose much more
cheaply; but I am not a hard man, and I do
not flatter myself when I say that conscience
is the dominant factor in all my operations.
I felt that in the circumstances the owners
were entitled to consideration and that to
make my victory complete would be an abuse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
of power. It is hardly necessary to add that
my generosity had its prudent side, as has all
rational generosity. To have assailed the
properties too long in order to get them
cheap would have permanently impaired their
value; to have wiped out the owners utterly
would have caused a profound, possibly
dangerous, public resentment against my
class, too many members of which had been
guilty of the grave blunder of using their
power without regard to public opinion. But
while prudence was a factor in my general
settlement, the main factor was, as I have said,
conscience. Not the narrow conscientiousness
of ordinary men, which is three parts ignorance,
two parts cowardice, and five parts
envy&mdash;for is it not usually roused only when
the acts of others are to be judged?</p>

<p>When my offer was accepted I organised a
combination to take over the properties, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
I paid for them with its guaranteed bonds and
preferred stock. Then I countermanded the
order for a heavy secret rebate against their
products and, instead, issued an order for a
small secret rebate in their favour&mdash;letting the
public think I had by some secret audacious
move regained control of my third railroad.
The combination&#8217;s business boomed, its stock
went up, and all that it was necessary for me
to sell was eagerly bought. What with the
bonds and the stocks I sold, I had gained control
without its having cost me a penny. It is
not vanity, is it, when I call that genius?</p>

<p>But control is not possession, and these
properties are worth possessing. I must possess
them. It is not just that so large a part
of the profits of my labour&mdash;of my act of
creation&mdash;should go to others.</p>

<p>I have anticipated somewhat. The operation
took a considerable time, but not long in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
view of the great results. When one has my
vast resources and my peculiar talents, men
and events <i>move</i>, obstacles are blown up, roads
are thrust swift and straight through the
thickest tangles, and the objective is reached
before feeble folk have got beyond the stage
of debate and diplomacy. Still, nearly a year
elapsed between the start and the finish, and
many things happened which were the reverse
of satisfactory&mdash;most of them, as usual, in my
domestic affairs.</p>

<p>I had got the enterprise only fairly under
way when the invitations for Walter&#8217;s wedding
were issued. Natalie&#8217;s father had seen
me several times and had shown his determination
to intervene in the matter of her dowry
by bringing up the subject at our business
conferences whenever he could force the smallest
opening. Like all my associates, from
capitalist to clerk, he is in awe of me. I see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
to it that in the velvet glove there shall always
be holes through which the iron hand can be
plainly seen. That often saves me the exertion
of using it. An iron hand, once it has an
established reputation, is mightier when merely
seen than when felt. He would always
begin by some vague, halting reference to my
promised generosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;A royal gift, Galloway!&#8221; he would say,
enthusiastically. &#8220;You certainly are a king,
much more powerful than those European figureheads.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he never had the courage to speak the
exact sum, the &#8220;quarter of a million dollars a
year,&#8221; that I saw in his hungry, glistening,
hopeful, yet doubtful eyes. And I would not
take the hint to discuss the gift further, but
would put him off by showing how completely
I was absorbed in the forming combination.
Probably at the time he was letting his greed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
blind him into believing I would make as big
a fool of myself as I had rashly promised and
so was fearful of irritating me in any way.
Two days before the wedding invitations went
out he forced himself on me for lunch. I saw
determination written in his face&mdash;determination
to compel me to something definite about
that &#8220;quarter of a million a year&#8221; for his
daughter. So, at the first pause in the conversation,
I played my card.</p>

<p>&#8220;Matt,&#8221; said I, &#8220;I really must arrange the
formalities for that settlement on <i>our</i> daughter.
I&#8217;ll have my lawyer&mdash;will the latter part
of the week do? He&#8217;s up to his eyes in the
combination just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bradish looked enormously relieved. He
could hardly keep from laughing outright
with delight&mdash;the miserable old seller of his
own children. &#8220;Oh, I wasn&#8217;t disturbing myself,&#8221;
he replied; &#8220;your word&#8217;s good enough,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
though, of course, you&#8217;d&mdash;we&#8217;d&mdash;want the
thing in legal shape&mdash;before the marriage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said I, waving the matter aside
as settled, and beginning again on the affairs
of the combination. I had let him into it on
attractive terms and had put him on my board
of directors. He revelled in these favours as
the mere foretaste of his gains from the powerful
commercial alliance he was making
through his daughter.</p>

<p>Out went the invitations&mdash;and the first danger
point was rounded.</p>

<p>On the following Sunday night I left suddenly
in my private car for an inspection of
the new properties. Every day of nearly two
weeks was full to its last minute. When I returned
to New York five days before the wedding,
I was utterly worn out. I went to bed
and sent for my doctor&mdash;Hanbury.</p>

<p>He is one of those highly successful New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
York physicians who are famed among the
laity for their skill in medicine, and in the profession
for their skill at hocus-pocus. He is
a specialist in what I may call the diseases
of the idle rich&mdash;boredom, exaggeration of a
slight discomfort into a frightful torture, craving
for fussy personal attentions, abnormal
fear of death, etc. He is a professional &#8220;funny
man,&#8221; a discreet but depraved gossip, and
a tireless listener&mdash;and is handsome and well-mannered.
He has a soft, firm touch&mdash;on
pulse and on purse. The women adore him&mdash;when
they want to rest, they complain of nervousness
and send for him to prescribe for
them. One of his most successful and lucrative
lines of treatment is helping wives to
loosen the purse-strings of husbands by agitating
their sympathies and fears. He never
irritates or frightens his clients with unpleasant
truths. He doesn&#8217;t tell the men to stop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
eating and drinking and the women to stop
gadding. He gives them digestion-tablets
and nerve-tonics and sends them on agreeable
excursions to Europe. Of all the swarm of
parasites that live upon rich New Yorkers
none keeps up a more dignified front than
does Hanbury. I&#8217;ve found him useful in social
matters, and, as I&#8217;ve paid him liberally,
he is greatly in my debt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hanbury,&#8221; I said, from my bed, &#8220;I&#8217;m a
very sick man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense&mdash;only tired,&#8221; replied he. &#8220;A
good sleep, a few days&#8217; rest&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked at him steadily. &#8220;I tell you I&#8217;m
desperately ill, and here&#8217;s my son&#8217;s wedding
only five days away!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be all right by that time. I&#8217;ll guarantee
to fix you up, good as new.&#8221;</p>

<p>I continued to look at him steadily. &#8220;No,
I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t&mdash;it&#8217;s impossible. And I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
able to transact any business whatever. I
mustn&#8217;t be allowed to see even the members of
my own family. Do you understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>He glanced curiously at me, then reflected,
twisting the end of his Van Dyck beard. He
looked at my tongue, listened to my heart, felt
my pulse, and took my temperature. &#8220;I&#8217;m
afraid you&#8217;re right,&#8221; he said, gravely; &#8220;I see
you&#8217;re worse off than I thought. We must
have a trained nurse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I must have you, too,&#8221; said I. &#8220;You
must move into the house, and I don&#8217;t want
anybody but you to attend me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. You know I&#8217;m at your service.
I&#8217;ll&mdash;<i>superintend</i> the nurse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Hanbury,&#8221; said I. &#8220;You understand
me perfectly. I can trust you. And&mdash;something
might happen to me&mdash;I&#8217;ll write
you a check for ten thousand at once&mdash;a little
personal matter quite apart from your bill.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>Hanbury reddened. I think he thought he
was hesitating. But when he spoke it was to
say: &#8220;Thank you&mdash;if you wish&mdash;but I&#8217;m sure
I&#8217;ll pull you through.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be able to see <i>no one</i>,&#8221; I went on.
&#8220;But I&#8217;ve set my heart on my son&#8217;s marrying&mdash;the
wedding <i>must not be put off</i>. I&#8217;m sure
it would kill me if there were to be a delay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand.&#8221; His eyes were smiling;
the rest of his face was grave.</p>

<p>&#8220;And not a word of the serious nature of
my illness must get into the papers. You will
deny any rumour of that kind, should there be
occasion. My stocks must not be affected&mdash;and
they would be, and the whole list&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the prosperity of the country,&#8221; said
Hanbury.</p>

<p>This illness of mine, while primarily for
smoothly carrying through Walter&#8217;s marriage,
was really inspired by an actual physical need.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
I had long felt that the machine needed rest.
The necessity of preventing Natalie from
making a fool of herself gave me the opportunity
to combine rest with accomplishment.
Before shutting myself in I had put my
affairs into such shape that my lieutenants
and secretaries could look after them. I dozed
and slept and listened to the nurse or Hanbury
reading, or talked with Hanbury. The nurse
had little to do&mdash;and I suspect could do little.
What Hanbury did not do was done by my
stupid old Pigott, half crazed with fear lest
I should die and he should find that he was
right in suspecting he had not been handsomely
remembered in my will. Hanbury&#8217;s
manner was so perfect that, had I not felt
robustly well on long sleep, short diet, and no
annoyances, I might have been convinced and
badly frightened. My family&mdash;Hanbury
managed to keep them from thinking it necessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
to try to impress me with their affection
for me by pretending wild alarm. He had
most difficulty with poor little Helen&mdash;not so
very little any more, though I think of her as
a baby still. It&#8217;s astonishing how unspoiled
she is&mdash;another proof of her unusuality.</p>

<p>On the third day Hanbury said: &#8220;Your
wife tells me she must see you, and that, if
she doesn&#8217;t, the wedding will surely be postponed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s impossible to admit her&mdash;when I&#8217;m
just entering the crisis,&#8221; replied I. &#8220;Tell her&mdash;you
know how to do it&mdash;that, if Bradish acts
up, she shall as a last resort go to Burridge,
who will let him see my will. And can&#8217;t you
call&mdash;don&#8217;t you think you had better call&mdash;some
one&mdash;say Doctor Lowndes&mdash;in consultation?&#8221;</p>

<p>He reflected for several minutes. &#8220;I&#8217;ll call
Lowndes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You couldn&#8217;t possibly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
have picked out a better man.&#8221; And he looked
at me with the admiration I deserved.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let Bradish know you&#8217;ve done it,&#8221; I added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; he replied, in a tone which assured
me he knew what to do at the right time.</p>

<p>Lowndes came&mdash;and went. A quarter of
an hour before he came Hanbury gave me a
dose of some strong-smelling, yellow-black
medicine. The blood bounded through my
arteries and throbbed with fierce violence in
my veins; I sank into a sort of stupor. I
dimly realised that another man was in the
room with Hanbury and was making a hasty
examination of me. It must have been an
amusing farce. Lowndes indorsed Hanbury,
and&mdash;yesterday I paid Lowndes&#8217;s bill for
twelve hundred dollars.</p>

<p>I fell asleep while he was still solemnly
studying Hanbury&#8217;s temperature chart.
When I awoke the latter was reading by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
shaded electric light on the night-stand. I
felt somewhat dazed and tired, but otherwise
extremely comfortable.</p>

<p>&#8220;What news?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your wife says the wedding is to go on&mdash;a
quiet ceremony at Mr. Bradish&#8217;s house. I fear
I gave him the impression that, while there
was no immediate danger, you would&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly pull through?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear so.&#8221;</p>

<p>That amused me. &#8220;Did he see my will?&#8221; I
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe he did. I think that was what
decided him.&#8221;</p>

<p>And well it might, for not only had he read
that I had willed three-fourths of my entire
estate to my son Walter, but also he had read
a schedule of my chief holdings which I had
folded in with the will in anticipation of this
very contingency. It must have amazed him&mdash;it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
must have stirred every atom in his avaricious
old body&mdash;to see how much richer I am
than is generally supposed. No, it would have
been impossible for him to take any chances
on losing my principal heir for his daughter
after that will and that schedule had burned
themselves into his brain.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve not the slightest doubt that he knew
his daughter would never get the dowry she
was dreaming of, for he is a sensible, practical
man. If I did not know how glibly young
people talk and think of huge sums of money
nowadays I&#8217;d not believe Natalie herself silly
enough ever seriously to imagine me giving
her outright the enormous sum necessary to
produce a quarter of a million a year.</p>

<p>Hanbury urged that Walter and his bride
go down to the country near town, assuring
them he could give them several hours&#8217; warning
of a turn for the worse. The change in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
the wedding plans had started a report that I
was dangerously ill. As the best possible denial
of this stock-depressing rumour they
yielded to Hanbury&#8217;s representations.</p>

<p>I ordered Hanbury to give it out that I was
much better, as soon as I heard that the marriage
ceremony had been performed, and I
began to mend so rapidly that he, in alarm for
his reputation, begged me to restrain myself.
&#8220;I want people to say I worked a cure,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;not to say I worked a miracle&mdash;and then
wink.&#8221; In two weeks I was far enough advanced
for Walter and Natalie to sail on the
trip which my illness had delayed.</p>

<p>I was now free to give my entire attention
to my down-town affairs. My long rest had
made me young again and had given me fresh
points of view upon nearly every department
of my activity. Also I found that my success
with my big combination and my stupendous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
public gift had enormously increased my reputation.
Half one&#8217;s power comes from within
himself, the other half from the belief of other
people in him. My star was approaching the
zenith, and I saw it. I always work incessantly,
regardless of the position of my star&mdash;no
man who accomplishes great things ever
takes his mind off his work.</p>

<p>Not that I am one of those who disbelieve
in luck. Luck is the tide. When it is with
me, I reach port&mdash;if I row hard and steer
straight. When it is against me, I must still
row hard and steer straight to keep off the
rocks and be ready for the turn.</p>

<p>At my suggestion, my down-town confidential
man intimated to a few of the principal
men in the towns dependent on my mines and
factories that it would be gracious and fitting
to show in some public way their appreciation
of what I had done. Usually these demonstrations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
are extremely perfunctory, betraying
on the surface that they are got up either
by the man honoured or out of a reluctant
sense of decency and a lively sense of the right
way to get more favours. But in this instance
the suggestion met with a spontaneous and
universal response. All that my agents had
to do in the matter was to organise the enthusiasm
and relieve the entertainment committee
of the heavier expenses&mdash;such as railway
transportation, catering, music, and carriages.
The people did the rest.</p>

<p>They regarded me as their saviour&mdash;and so
I was. Could I not have destroyed them had
I willed it? Was I not inaugurating for them
a prosperity such as the former small-fry
owners of those properties had neither the
genius nor the resources to create?</p>

<p>The trouble with those who criticise the
morality of the actions of men like me is that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
they are trying to study astronomy with a
microscope.</p>

<p>Jack Ridley and I fell into an argument
along these lines one evening after dinner, and
the only answer he could make to me was,
&#8220;Then a murderer, on the same principle,
could say: &#8216;I&#8217;m killing this man so that his
family, to whom he&#8217;s really of no use, may get
his life insurance and live comfortably and
happily. I&#8217;m not doing it because I want
what he has in his pockets&mdash;though I&#8217;ll take
it partially to repay me for risking my neck.&#8217;&#8221;
I couldn&#8217;t help smiling&mdash;he put it so plausibly.
I should have reasoned precisely like that
twenty years ago. But my mind and my conscience
have grown since then. I no longer
look out upon life through the twisted glass
of the windows of the House of Have-not; I
see it through the clear French-plate of the
House of Have.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>When the programme for my testimonial
was perfected, a joint delegation from the
city governments, the chambers of commerce,
and the ministers&#8217; associations of the five
towns waited upon me to invite me to a grand
joint reception and banquet to be held in the
largest town. They invited my wife, also, but
I did not permit her to accept. In the first
place, she had done nothing to entitle her to
divide the honour with me; and, in the second
place, she would have had her head even more
utterly turned than it now is. On the appointed
day I went up in my private car,
taking Burridge and Jack Ridley with me. I
had outlined to Ridley what I wished to say,
and he had expanded it into the necessary
three speeches. In the main he caught the
spirit of my ideas very cleverly. The only
editing I had to do was in striking out a lot
of self-deprecatory rubbish which would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
made me minimise my part in the new era for
the towns. A man is a fool who assists his
enemies to rob him of what is justly his. How
could I expect any one to have a proper respect
for me if I did not show that I have a
proper respect for myself?</p>

<p>Where this so-called modesty is genuine it
is a dangerous weakness; where it is false, it is
hypocritical cowardice.</p>

<p>As the train carrying my car drew into the
station I stared amazed, much to the delight
of the reception committee, which had joined
me at the station below. Before me I saw ten
or twelve thousand people. The schoolgirls,
each dressed in white and carrying flowers,
occupied the front space&mdash;there must have
been a thousand of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wonderful! Wonderful!&#8221; I exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;There hasn&#8217;t been such an outpouring of
the people,&#8221; said a gentleman who stood near<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
me, &#8220;since Mr. Blaine passed through here
when he was a candidate for the presidency.&#8221;</p>

<p>I noted that several of the committee grew
red and frowned at him. Afterward Ridley
told me why&mdash;the Blaine demonstration had
led them to expect that he would carry the
county by an overwhelming majority; instead,
he had lost it by a &#8220;landslide&#8221; vote against him.</p>

<p>When the train stopped, a battery of artillery
began to fire a salute of one hundred
guns. Several bands struck up, the children
sang &#8220;The Star-Spangled Banner,&#8221; and the
crowd burst into frenzies of cheering. I was
overcome with emotion and the tears streamed
down my cheeks. At that the cheering was
more tremendous and I saw many of the
women and little girls crying.</p>

<p>I entered the carriage drawn by six horses,
the mayor of the town beside me, and the
march to the Court House began. I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
given my workingmen a holiday and my excursion
trains had poured the people of the
four other towns into this fifth town, about
quadrupling its population for the day. The
streets were therefore thronged from the
house-walls to the edges of a lane just wide
enough for the procession. The houses were
draped with bunting; arches of evergreens
and bunting, each bearing my name and words
of welcome, spanned the route of march at
frequent intervals. I stood all the way, my
hat in hand. As I bowed, the cheers answered
me. The bells in all the towers and steeples
rang, cannon boomed, and the procession, in
five divisions, each with a band and militia,
wound in my wake. My heart swelled with
triumph and with grateful appreciation. I
fully realised myself for the first time in my
life.</p>

<p>As I have said, I always did have a self-respecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
opinion of myself, even when an
over-nice and inexperienced conscience was
annoying me with its hair-splittings. As I
have grown older, and have seen the inferiority
of other men and the superiority of my
own mind and judgment, naturally my early
opinion has been strengthened and deepened.
But on that day I realised how my own sight
of myself had been obscured by a too close
view. My domestic exasperations, the necessary
disagreeableness and pettiness of so many
of the details of my great projects, the triviality
of my routine of business and its harassments&mdash;all
these had combined to make me
belittle my own stature and bulk. On that
day I saw myself as others see me. I felt a
great uplifting, a supreme disdain for those
who oppose me or cavil at me, a high and firm
resolve to devote myself thereafter more confidently
and more boldly to my plans.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>But&mdash;the more splendid the crown, the more
splitting the headache.</p>

<p>At the banquet in the evening I observed
that the enthusiasm of the daytime was not
being sustained. I was amazed and irritated
by the large number of vacant places at the
tables, when my agents had been instructed
judiciously and quietly to distribute free tickets
should there not be a sufficient number
of persons able to pay the five dollars a plate
we were charging for a nine-dollar dinner. I
was puzzled by the nervous uneasiness of those
who sat with me at the table of honour and
who had been all geniality a few hours before.
The speeches seemed to me halting and inadequate&mdash;my
own speech, well calculated to
rouse local pride, was received with a faint
hand-clapping which soon died away. After
the dinner I, Burridge, and Ridley drove
alone to the station. It was filled with weary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
throngs taking the returning excursion trains.
They did not cheer me; they only stared curiously.</p>

<p>When we were on our way back to New
York I wished to discuss the triumph with my
two companions, but Burridge was dumb and
Ridley morose. In the morning I called for
the New York dailies; they were haltingly
produced. Imagine my amazement when I
saw, in many kinds of type, now jubilant, now
regretful, now apologetic headlines, all agreeing
that my reception was a <i>fiasco</i>. Only my
stanch &mdash;&mdash; printed the truth, and it laid entirely
too much stress upon the &#8220;act of malicious
and mendacious demagoguery.&#8221; That
act was: Some enemy of mine had discovered
inside facts as to my manipulation of freight
rates to get control of the mines and factories,
and, late in the afternoon, in the interval between
the reception and the banquet, a New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
York newspaper containing what purported
to be a full account of my machinations had
been hawked about the streets, and was read
by everybody&mdash;except me.</p>

<p>I do not here deny that the basic facts were
practically true as printed. But the worst
possible colour was given to them, and the
worst possible motives of rapacity and conscienceless
cruelty were ascribed to me. Instead
of showing that I was like a general who
sacrifices a comparative few in order that he
may save millions and advance a great cause,
the wretched rag held me up as a swindler and
robber&mdash;worse, as an assassin!</p>

<p>I understood all, and sympathised with my
hosts, the people of those five towns, in their
embarrassment. As their local newspapers,
which I got the next day, assured me, they did
not believe the slanderous story. But I can
readily see how nervous it must have made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
them. It is fortunate for them that they had
the good sense to discern the truth. Had I
been insulted, I should have taken a terrible
revenge, even though it had cost me several
hundred thousand dollars.</p>

<p>While I was reading those New York papers,
Jack Ridley was smoking a cigar at the
opposite side of the breakfast-table. When
I had finished, I spoke. &#8220;Did you see that
newspaper yesterday?&#8221; I demanded, my rage
hardly able to wait upon his answer before
bursting.</p>

<p>Ridley nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Burridge?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;he saw it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you tell me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bad news will always keep.&#8221;</p>

<p>I shouted for Burridge, and, when he came,
ordered him into a seat. &#8220;At every step in my
career I&#8217;ve been harassed and hampered by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
petty minds,&#8221; I said&mdash;&#8220;not among my enemies,
for there they have been a help, but
among my employees and servants of every
kind. How often have I told both of you
never to think for me? I don&#8217;t pay you to
<i>think</i>&mdash;I pay you to <i>do</i> what <i>I</i> think. Had
you told me I could have met this slander
when and where it showed itself and would
have choked it to death. As it is, everybody
except you two believes I knew and was silent.
Fortunately my reputation is strong enough
to compel them to put a decent interpretation
on my silence. But no thanks to you! I discharge
you both.&#8221;</p>

<p>Burridge rose and went to the other part of
the car&mdash;and I did not see him again. Ridley
fell to whimpering and crying, and for old
friendship&#8217;s sake, and because the poor devil
is useful in his way, I took him back at two-thirds
his former pay. His gratitude was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
really touching&mdash;sometimes I think he&#8217;s honestly
fond of me, though no doubt the wages
and what he has free enter into it. He&#8217;s one
of those fellows who actually enjoy licking the
hand they fear. Burridge did not try to get
himself reinstated. Probably he thought himself
indispensable and held aloof in the belief
that I would beg him to come back. But I
was on the whole glad to get rid of him. He
was too much of an alleged gentleman for the
work he had to do. There&#8217;s room for only one
gentleman in my establishment.</p>

<p>Into his place I put a young chap named
Cress who had been near me at the office for
several years and had shown loyalty, energy,
and discretion. He was not at his new work
a week before my wife came to me in a hot
temper and demanded that he be dismissed.
&#8220;He has insulted me!&#8221; she said, her head rearing
and her nose in the air.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>&#8220;How?&#8221; I asked; &#8220;I can&#8217;t discharge a faithful
servant on a mere caprice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has dared to question my accounts,&#8221;
she replied, in her grandest manner.</p>

<p>This was interesting! &#8220;But that&#8217;s his business,&#8221;
said I; &#8220;that&#8217;s what I pay him for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To insult your wife?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To guard my money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Burridge never found it necessary to
insult me in guarding your money. He ventured
to assume that as your wife I was to be
respected, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Burridge had no right to assume any such
thing,&#8221; I said. &#8220;He was nothing but my machine&mdash;my
cash-register. I instructed him,
again and again, to assume that everybody
was dishonest. A ridiculous mess I should
make of my affairs if I did not keep a most
rigid system of checks upon everybody. You
must remember, my dear, that I am beset by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
hungry fellows, many of them clever and
courageous, waiting for me to relax my vigilance
so that they can swoop on my fortune.
I&#8217;m moving through a swarm of parasites who
prey upon my prey or upon me, and the larger
I become the larger the swarm and the more
dangerous. I must have eyes everywhere.
You should be reasonable.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave me a curious look. &#8220;And you&#8217;re
so sublimely unconscious of yourself!&#8221; she
said. &#8220;That is why you are so terrible. But
it saves you from being repulsive.&#8221; I was instantly
on the alert. Flattery tickles me&mdash;and
tickling wakes me. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you see, you
great monster of a man,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;that
you mustn&#8217;t treat your wife and children as if
they were parasites?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They must keep their accounts with my
fortune straight,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>To that point I held while she cajoled,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
stormed, denounced, threatened, wept. The
longer she worked upon me the more set I became,
for the more firmly I was convinced that
there had been some sort of chicanery at which
that weak fool Burridge had winked. She
was greatly agitated&mdash;and not with anger&mdash;when
she left me, though she tried to conceal
it. I sent for Cress and ordered him to hunt
out Burridge&#8217;s accounts and vouchers for the
past fifteen years, or ever since I put my domestic
finances on the sound basis of business.
I told him to take everything to an expert
accountant.</p>

<p>After two days&#8217; search he reported to me
that he could find accounts for only nine years
back and vouchers for only the last three
years. The rest had been lost or deliberately
destroyed&mdash;contrary to my emphatic orders.
One of the curses of large affairs with limited
time and imbecile agents is the vast number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
of ragged ends hanging out. I never take up
any part of my business after having disregarded
it for a while without finding it ravelled
and ravelling. A week later I had the
accountant&#8217;s report, reviewed by Cress. I
read it with amazement. I sent at once for
my wife. I ordered Cress out of the room as
soon as she entered, for I wished to spare her
all unnecessary humiliation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madam,&#8221; said I, without the slightest
heat, &#8220;you will kindly make over to me all my
money and property which you have got by
juggling your accounts. It&#8217;s about half a
million, I think&mdash;Cress and I may presently
discover that it is more. But, whatever it is,
it must all be made over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have nothing that belongs to you,&#8221;
she replied, as calm as I, and facing me
steadily.</p>

<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t quibble,&#8221; said I, determined to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
keep my temper. &#8220;All you have must be made
over. I give you until&mdash;day after to-morrow
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall answer then as I answer now,&#8221; she
said&mdash;and I saw that she felt cornered and
would fight to the last.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve often heard,&#8221; I went on, &#8220;that some
wives take advantage of their husbands&#8217; carelessness
and confidence to&mdash;to&mdash;I shall not use
the proper word&mdash;I shall say to <i>reserve</i> from
the household and personal allowances by
over-charges, by conspiring with tradespeople
of all kinds, by making out false bills, by substitution
of jewels&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is true enough,&#8221; she interrupted.
&#8220;Women who thought they were marrying
men and find they are married to monsters
sometimes do imitate their husbands&#8217; methods
in a small, feeble way, and for self-defence
and for the defence of their children, and I&#8217;m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
one of those women. I&#8217;m ashamed of it&mdash;you&#8217;ve
not hardened me beyond shame yet.
But in another sense I&#8217;m not ashamed of it&mdash;I&#8217;m&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t quarrel,&#8221; said I; &#8220;I&#8217;m not the
keeper of your conscience. All I say is&mdash;disgorge!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve nothing that belongs to you,&#8221; she repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you deny that you have sto&mdash;&#8221; I
began.</p>

<p>&#8220;I deny nothing. I have learned much
from you since you ceased to be a man, but
I&#8217;ve not yet learned how to educate my conscience
into being my pander.&#8221;</p>

<p>I smiled and pointed significantly at the
cooked accounts. &#8220;Yes&mdash;here&#8217;s the evidence
how sensitive your conscience is and how it
must trouble you!&#8221; I couldn&#8217;t resist saying
this. It was a mistake, as retorts always are&mdash;for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
it was the spark that touched off her
temper.</p>

<p>&#8220;My conscience does trouble me!&#8221; she blazed
out&mdash;&#8220;troubles me because I have remained in
this house all these years. I have permitted
myself and my children to become corrupted.
I have been content with merely trying to provide
against your going mad with vanity and
greediness, and turning against your own
children. I am guilty&mdash;though I stayed first
through weakness and love of you&mdash;guilty
because afterward it was weakness and love
of what your wealth bought that kept me.
But I thought it was my duty to my children.
I should have gone and taken them with me.
I should have gone the day I learned you had
stolen Judson&#8217;s&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>In my fury I almost struck her. The very
mention of Judson&#8217;s name makes me irresponsible.
But she did not flinch. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
on, &#8220;and if you persist in your demand, if you
don&#8217;t call off that miserable spy of yours, I
tell you, James Galloway, I&#8217;ll walk out of
your house publicly and never set foot in it
again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After you have disgorged,&#8221; said I, getting
and keeping myself well in hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall go,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;and what will
become of your social ambitions, of your pet
scheme to marry Aurora to Horton Kirkby,
of your public reputation? If I go, the
whole country shall ring with the scandal
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I hadn&#8217;t thought of that! I saw instantly
that she had me. With a scandal of that kind
public, it would be impossible to marry Aurora
into one of the oldest and proudest and richest
families in New York. I knew just how it
would impress old Mrs. Kirkby, who, if her
notion of her social position were correct,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
would find all New York on its knees as she
took the air in her victoria. Then there was
Natalie&mdash;it would surely stir her up to do
something disagreeable when she learns that
she isn&#8217;t going to get the quarter of a million
a year she&#8217;s dreaming of.</p>

<p>I studied my wife carefully as she stood
facing me, and afterward, while we went on
with our talk, and saw that she meant just
what she said, I pretended to believe her statement
that she hadn&#8217;t more than a small part
of her &#8220;commissions&#8221; left&mdash;indeed, it may be
so. With this pretence as a basis, I let her off
from disgorging. &#8220;But,&#8221; said I, &#8220;hereafter
Cress manages the household&mdash;<i>all</i> the accounts&mdash;I
can&#8217;t trust you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As you will,&#8221; she replied, affecting indifference.
Probably she was so relieved by my
consenting to drop the past that she was glad
to concede the future.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>If women were as large as they are crafty,
it would be the men who would stay at home
and mind the babies. As it is they can only
irritate and hamper the men. It is fortunate
for me that women have never had influence
over me. I&#8217;d not be where I am if I had taken
them seriously.</p>

<p>Soon after this shocking discovery there
happened what was, in some respects, the most
unpleasant incident of my life.</p>

<p>One afternoon, as the heating apparatus in
my sitting-room was out of order, I went
down to the library and was lying on the
lounge thinking out some of the day&#8217;s business
complications. I was presently disturbed by
the sound of excited voices&mdash;my wife&#8217;s and
my daughter Helen&#8217;s. The noise came from
the small reception-room adjoining the library.
It is very annoying to hear voices, especially
agitated voices, and not to be able to distinguish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
the words. I rose and went quietly to
the connecting door and listened.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t have it, Helen!&#8221; my wife was saying.
&#8220;You know that is the most exclusive
dancing class in New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care; I shall never go again&mdash;<i>never</i>!&#8221;
The child&#8217;s voice was as resolute as
it was angry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Helen, you must not speak in that way to
your mother!&#8221; replied my wife. &#8220;Unless you
give a good reason, you must go&mdash;and there
can&#8217;t be any reason.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask me, mother!&#8221; she pleaded.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must tell me why. I insist.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a long silence, then Helen said:
&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you any more than that some of
the girls&mdash;insult me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What <i>do</i> you mean?&#8221; exclaimed my wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;Several of them turn their backs on me,
and won&#8217;t speak to me, and look at me&mdash;<i>oh</i>!&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
That exclamation came in a burst of fury.
&#8220;And they sneer at me to the boys&mdash;and some
of them won&#8217;t speak to me, either.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was another silence. Then my wife
said: &#8220;You must expect that, Helen. So
many are envious of your father&#8217;s&mdash;of his
wealth, that they try to take their spite out
upon us. But you must have pride. The way
to deal with such a situation is to face it&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>All the blame upon <i>me</i>! I could not endure
it. I put the door very softly and very slightly
ajar and returned to the lounge. From
there I called out: &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget the other
reason, madam, while you&#8217;re teaching your
child to respect her parents.&#8221; Then I rose
and went into the reception-room.</p>

<p>Helen was white as a sheet. My wife was
smiling a little&mdash;satirically. &#8220;Eavesdropping?&#8221;
she said&mdash;apparently not in the least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
disturbed at my having heard her insidious
attack upon me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could not help overhearing your quarrel,&#8221;
I replied, &#8220;and I felt it was time for me
to speak. No doubt your lack of skill in social
matters is the chief cause of this outrage upon
Helen. Of what use is it for me to toil and
struggle when you cannot take advantage of
what my achievement ought to make so easy
for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father&mdash;&#8221; interrupted Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your mother is right,&#8221; I said, turning to
her. &#8220;You must go to the class. In a short
time all these unpleasant incidents will be over.
If any of those children persist, you will give
me their names. I think I know how to bring
their fathers to terms, if your mother is unable
to cope with their mothers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; Helen repeated, &#8220;it wasn&#8217;t on
<i>her</i> account that they&mdash;they&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>This exasperated me afresh. &#8220;Your mother
has trained you well, I see,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Now&mdash;I
tell you that what you say is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She started to her feet, her eyes flashing,
her breath coming fast. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you why I
came home to-day and said I&#8217;d never go there
again. I was talking to Herbert Merivale at
the dance, this afternoon, and his sister Nell
and Lottie Stuyvesant were sitting near, and
Lottie said, loud, so that Herbert and I would
hear: &#8216;I don&#8217;t see why your brother talks to
her. None of the very nice boys and girls will
have anything to do with her, you know.
How can we when she&#8217;s&mdash;she&#8217;s&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen stopped, her face flushed, and her
head dropped. My wife said: &#8220;Go on, Helen;
what was it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;When she&#8217;s the&mdash;the&mdash;daughter of a&mdash;<i>thief</i>!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>I was so overwhelmed that I fairly staggered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
into a chair. Helen darted to me and
knelt beside me. &#8220;And I <i>won&#8217;t</i> go there
again! I didn&#8217;t show her that I was cut. I
didn&#8217;t feel cut. I only felt what a great, noble
father I have, and how low and contemptible
all those girls and boys and their parents are.
I stayed until nearly the last. But I&#8217;ll never
go again. You won&#8217;t ask me to, will you,
father?&#8221;</p>

<p>I patted her on the shoulder. It was impossible
for me to answer her. Whether through
fear of me or to gain her point with her child,
my wife concealed the triumph she must have
felt, and said: &#8220;The more reason for going,
Helen. Where is your pride? If you should
stay away, they would say it was because you
were ashamed&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that isn&#8217;t the reason,&#8221; interrupted
Helen. &#8220;And I don&#8217;t care what <i>they</i> think!&#8221;
she added, scornfully.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>I have never been in such a rage as possessed
me at that moment. I felt an insane
impulse to rush out and strangle and torture
those envious wretches who were seeking to
revenge themselves for having been worsted
in the encounter with me down-town by humiliating
my children. But the matter of
Helen&#8217;s holding the social advantage we had
gained when we got the Merivales to put her
in that class was too important to be neglected
for a burst of impotent fury. I joined with
her mother, and finally we brought her round
to see that she must keep on at the class and
must make a fight to overthrow the <i>clique</i> of
traducers of her father. When she saw it her
enthusiasm was roused, and&mdash;well, she can&#8217;t
fail to win with her cleverness and good looks,
and with me to back her up.</p>

<p>What that miserable girl said in her hearing,
and her expression as she repeated it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
comes back to me again and again, and, somehow,
I feel as if old Judson were getting revenge
upon me. First James&mdash;and now
Helen! But James believed it, while Helen,
splendid girl that she is, knew at once that it
was untrue. At least, I think so.</p>

<p>What an ugly word &#8220;thief&#8221; is! And how
ugly it sounds from the lips of my child&mdash;even
when there is no real justification for it!
I know that all who come in contact with me,
whether socially or in business, envy and hate
me. It seems to me now that I know the
thought in their spiteful brains&mdash;know the
word that trembles on their lips but dares not
come out.</p>

<p>Yesterday I turned upon my wife when we
were alone for a moment. I have felt that
she has been gloating over me ever since that
afternoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; I said, angrily&mdash;for I have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
extremely irritable through sleeplessness of
late, &#8220;why don&#8217;t you say it, instead of keeping
this cowardly silence? Why don&#8217;t you taunt
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>She showed what she&#8217;d been thinking by
understanding me instantly. &#8220;Taunt you!&#8221;
she said; &#8220;I&#8217;m trying to forget it&mdash;I&#8217;ve been
trying to forget it all these years. That&#8217;s why
I&#8217;m an old woman long before my time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her look was a very good imitation of
tragedy. I felt unable to answer her and so
begin a quarrel that might have relieved my
mind. The best I was able to do was to say,
sarcastically: &#8220;So that&#8217;s the reason, is it? I
had noted the fact, but was attributing it to
your anxiety about falsifying your accounts.&#8221;</p>

<p>I hurried away before she had a chance to
reply.</p>

</div>


<p>A curious kind of cowardice has been growing
on me of late. Whenever I feel the
slightest pain or ache&mdash;a twinge I&#8217;d not have
given a second thought to a year or so ago&mdash;I
send post-haste for my doctor, the ridiculous,
lying, flattering Hanbury. My intelligence
forbids me to put the least confidence
in him. I know he&#8217;d no more tell me
or any other rich man a disagreeable truth
than he&#8217;d tell one of his rich old women that
she was past the age of pleasing men. Yet
I send for Hanbury; and I swallow his lies
about my health, and urge him on to feed me
lies about my youthful appearance that are
even more absurd. I&#8217;m thinking of employing
him exclusively and keeping him by me&mdash;for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
companionship. Cress is worse than
worthless except for business, Jack is getting
stale and repetitive with age, and I badly need
some one to amuse me, to take my mind off
myself and my affairs and my family.</p>

<p>At this moment I happen to be in my mood
for mocking my fears and follies about the
end. The End!&mdash;I&#8217;m not afraid of what
comes after. All the horror I&#8217;m capable of
feeling goes into the thought of giving up my
crown and my sceptre, my millions and my
dominion over men and affairs. The afterward?
I&#8217;ve never had either the time or the
mind for the speculative and the intangible&mdash;at
least not since I passed the sentimental
period of youth.</p>

<p>Each day my power grows&mdash;and my love
of power and my impatience of opposition.
It seems to me sacrilege for any one to dare
oppose me when I have so completely vindicated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
my right to lead and to rule. I understand
those tyrants of history who used to be
abhorrent to me&mdash;much could be said in defence
of them. Once the power I now wield
would have seemed tremendous. And it is tremendous.
But I am so often galled by its
limitations, more often still by the absurd
obstacles that delay and fret me.</p>

<p>Early last month I found that down at
Washington they were about to pass a law
&#8220;regulating&#8221; railway rates, which means, of
course, lowering them and cutting my dividends
and disarranging my plans in general.
I telephoned Senator &mdash;&mdash;, whom we keep
down there to see that that sort of demagoguery
is held in check, to come to me in
New York at once. He appeared at my house
the same evening, full of excuses and apologies.
&#8220;The public clamour is so great,&#8221; said
he, &#8220;and the arguments of the opposition are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
so plausible, that we simply have to do something.
This bill is the least possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>I rarely argue with understrappers. I
merely told him to go to my lawyer&#8217;s house,
get the bill I had ordered drawn, take it back
to Washington on the midnight train, and put
it through. &#8220;You old women down there,&#8221;
said I, &#8220;seem incapable of learning that the
mob isn&#8217;t appeased, but is made hungrier, by
getting what it wants. Humbug&#8217;s the only
dish for it. Fill it full of humbug and it gets
indigestion and wishes it had never asked for
anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>My substitute was apparently more drastic
than the other bill, but I had ordered into it a
clause that would send it into the courts where
we could keep it shuffling back and forth for
years. To throw the demagogues off the
scent, Senator &mdash;&mdash; had it introduced by one
of the leaders of the opposition&mdash;as clever a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
dealer in humbug as ever took command of a
mob in order to set it brawling with itself at
the critical moment. Our fellows pretended
to yield with great reluctance to this &#8220;sweeping
and dangerous measure,&#8221; and it went
through both houses with a whirl.</p>

<p>The President was about to sign it when up
started that scoundrel &mdash;&mdash;, who owes his
fortune to me and who got his place on the
recommendation of several of us who thought
him a safe, loyal, honourable man. The rascal
pointed out the saving clause in my bill and
made such a stir in the newspapers that our
scheme was apparently ruined.</p>

<p>I quietly took a regular express for Washington,
keeping close to my drawing-room.
By roundabout orders from me a telegram
had been sent to a signal tower in the outskirts
of Washington, and it halted the train. In
the darkness I slipped away, hailed a cab, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
drove to &mdash;&mdash;&#8217;s house. He was taken completely
by surprise&mdash;I suppose he thought I&#8217;d
be afraid to come near him, or to try to reach
him in any way with those nosing newspapers
watching every move. The only excuse he
could make for himself was a whine about
&#8220;conscience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am taking the retaining fee of the people,&#8221;
said he; &#8220;I must serve their interests just
as I served you when I took your retainers.&#8221;
This was his plea at the end of a two hours&#8217;
talk in which I had exhausted argument and
inducement. I felt that gentleness and diplomacy
were in vain. I released my temper&mdash;temper
with me is not waste steam, but
powder to be saved until it can be exploded to
some purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;We put you in office, sir,&#8221; I replied, &#8220;and
we will put you out. You owe your honours
to us, not to this mob you&#8217;re pandering to now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
in the hope of getting something or other.
We&#8217;ll punish you for your treachery if you
persist in it. We&#8217;ll drop you back into obscurity,
and you&#8217;ll see how soon your &#8216;people&#8217;
will forget you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paled and quivered under the lash. &#8220;If
the people were not so sane and patient,&#8221; said
he, &#8220;they&#8217;d act like another Samson. They&#8217;d
pull the palace down upon themselves for the
pleasure of seeing you banqueting Philistines
get your deserts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t inflict a stump speech on me,&#8221; said
I, going to the door&mdash;it just occurred to
me that he might publicly eject me from his
house and so make himself too strong to be
dislodged immediately. &#8220;Within six months
you&#8217;ll be out of office&mdash;unless you come to
your senses.&#8221;</p>

<p>So I left him. A greater fool I never knew.
I can understand the out-in-the-cold fellow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
snapping his fangs; but for the life of me I
can&#8217;t understand a man with even a job as
waiter or crumb-scraper at the banquet doing
anything to get himself into trouble. He
proved not merely a fool, but a weak fool as
well; for, after a few days of thinking it over,
he switched round, withdrew his objection, and
explained it away&mdash;and so my bill was signed.
But we are done with him. A man may be
completely cured of an attack of insanity, but
who would ever give him a position of trust
afterward? Not I, for one. Too many men
who have never gone crazy are waiting, eager
to serve us.</p>

<p>Still, looking back over the incident, I am
not satisfied with myself. I won, but I played
badly. I must be careful&mdash;I am becoming too
arrogant. If he had been a little stronger and
cleverer, he would have had me thrown out of
his house, and I don&#8217;t care to think what a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
position that would have put me in, not only
then, but also for the future. As long as I
was engaged in hand-to-hand battle and had
personally to take what I got, it was well to
have an outward bearing that frightened the
timid and made the easy-going anxious to
conciliate me. But, now that I employ others
to retrieve the game I bring down, it is wiser
that I show courtesy and consideration. I get
better service; I cause less criticism. Enemies
are indispensable to a rising man&mdash;they put
him on his mettle and make people look on
him as important. But to a risen man they
are either valueless or a hindrance, and, at
critical moments, a danger.</p>

<p>It is one of the large ironies of life that
when one has with infinite effort gained power,
one dares not indulge in the great pleasure
of openly exercising it, for fear of losing it.
Not even I can eat my cake and have it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
Sometimes success seems to me to mean rising
to a height where one can more clearly see the
things one cannot have.</p>

<p>And now luck, plus strong rowing and
right steering, swept me on to another success&mdash;this
time a brilliant marriage. The element
of luck was particularly large in this instance,
as in any matter where one of the factors is
feminine. Every wise planner reduces the
human element in his projects to the minimum,
because human nature is as uncertain as
chance itself. But while one can always rely,
to a certain extent, upon the human element
where it is masculine, where it is feminine
there&#8217;s absolutely no more foundation than in
a quicksand. The women not only unsettle
the men, but they also unsettle themselves;
and, acting always upon impulse, they are as
likely as not to fly straight in the face of what
is best for them. Women are incapable of cooperation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
The only business they understand
or take a genuine interest in is the capture of
men&mdash;a business which each woman must pursue
independently and alone.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Aurora, like most of the young
women of our upper class, had been thoroughly
trained in correct ideas of self-interest.</p>

<p>She was born in the purple. When she
came into the world I had been a millionaire
several years, and my wife and I had changed
our point of view on life from that of the
lower middle class in which we were bred
(though we didn&#8217;t know it at the time, and
thought ourselves &#8220;as good as anybody&#8221;), to
that of the upper class, to which my genius
forced our admission. Aurora was our first
child to have a French nurse, the first to have
teachers at home&mdash;a French governess and a
German one.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>James had gone to the public school and
then to Phillips Exeter; Walter had gone to
public school a little while, and then to &mdash;&mdash;,
where he was prepared for Harvard, not in a
mixed and somewhat motley crowd, as James
was, but in a company made up exclusively of
youths of his own class, the sons of those who
are aristocratic by birth or by achievement.
Aurora was even more exclusively educated.
She&mdash;with difficulty, as we were still new to
our position&mdash;was got into a small class of
aristocratic children that met at the house of
the parents of two of them. Each day she
went there in one of our carriages with her
French nursery governess, promoted to be her
companion; and, when the class was over for
the day, the companion called for her in the
carriage and took her home.</p>

<p>All Aurora&#8217;s young friends were girls like
herself, bred in the strictest ideas of the responsibilities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
of their station, and intent upon
making a social success, and, of course, a successful
marriage. At the time, my wife, who
had not then been completely turned by the
adulation my wealth had brought her, used to
express to me her doubts whether these children
were not too sordid. I was half inclined
to agree with her, for it isn&#8217;t pleasant to hear
mere babies talk of nothing but dresses and
jewels, palaces and liveries and carriages,
good &#8220;catches,&#8221; and social position. But I see
now that there is no choice between that sort
of education and sheer sentimentalism. It is
far better that children who are to inherit millions
and the responsibilities of high station
should be over-sordid than over-sentimental.
Sordidness will never lead them into the ruinous
mischief of prodigality and bad marriages;
sentimentalism is almost certain to
do so.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>My wife was extremely careful, as the
mothers of our class must be, to scan the
young men who were permitted to talk with
Aurora. Only the eligible had the opportunity
to get well acquainted with her&mdash;indeed,
I believe Horton Kirkby was the first man she
really knew well.</p>

<p>It was a surprise to me when Kirkby began
to show a preference for her. His mother is
one of the leaders of that inner circle of fashionable
society which still barred the doors
haughtily against us, though it admitted many
who were glad to be our friends&mdash;perhaps I
should say <i>my</i> friends. Kirkby himself keenly
delighted in the power which his combination
of vast wealth, old family, and impregnable
social position gave him. Every one supposed
he would marry in his own set. But Aurora
got a chance at him, and&mdash;well, Aurora inherits
something of my magnetism and luck.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
Kirkby&#8217;s coldness to me at the outset and his
mother&#8217;s deliberately snubbing us again and
again make me think his intentions were not
then serious. But Aurora alternately fired
and froze him with such skill that she succeeded
in raising in his mind a doubt which
had probably never entered it before&mdash;a doubt
of his ability to marry any woman he might
choose. So, she triumphed.</p>

<p>But after they were engaged she continued
to play fast and loose with him. At first I
thought this was only clever man&#339;uvring on
her part to keep him uncertain and interested.
But I presently began to be uneasy and sent
her mother to question her adroitly. &#8220;She
says,&#8221; my wife reported to me, &#8220;that she can&#8217;t
take him and she can&#8217;t give him up. She says
there&#8217;s one thing she&#8217;d object to more than to
marrying him, and that is to seeing some other
girl marry him.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>&#8220;What nonsense!&#8221; said I; &#8220;I thought she
was too well brought up for such folly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must admit Kirkby is&mdash;clammy,&#8221; replied
my wife, always full of excuses for her
children.</p>

<p>Before I could move to bring Aurora to her
senses, Kirkby did it&mdash;by breaking off the engagement
and transferring his attentions to
Mary Stuyvesant, poor as poverty but beautiful
and well born. Within a week Aurora
had him back; within a fortnight she had the
cards out for the wedding.</p>

<p>The presents began to pour in; two rooms
down-stairs were filling with magnificence,
and we had sent several van loads to the safety
deposit vaults. There must have been close
upon half a million dollars&#8217; worth, including
my gift of a forty-thousand-dollar tiara. Every
one in the house was agitated. I had given
my wife and daughter <i>carte blanche</i>, releasing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
Cress and Jack Ridley from attendance on me
to assist them and to see that extravagance did
not spread into absolutely wanton waste. But
this does not mean that I was not in hearty
sympathy with my wife&#8217;s efforts to make the
full realisation of our social ambition a memorable
occasion. On the contrary, I wanted
precisely that; and I knew the way to accomplish
it was by getting five cents&#8217; worth for
every five cents spent, not by imitating the
wastefulness of the ignorant poor. I was
willing that the dollars should fly; but I
was determined that each one should hit the
mark.</p>

<p>Jack Ridley said to me once: &#8220;Why, to you
five hundred dollars is less than one dollar
would be to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; I replied; &#8220;we cling to five
cents more tightly than you would to five dollars.
We know the value of money because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
we have it; you don&#8217;t know because you
haven&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the happiest, most interested person in
all the household was my daughter Helen.
She was to be maid of honour, and on the wedding
day was to make her first appearance in
a long dress. It seemed to me that she suddenly
flashed out into wonderful beauty&mdash;a
strange kind of beauty, all in shades of golden
brown and having an air of mystery that
moved even me to note and admire and be
proud&mdash;and a little uneasy. Obviously she
would be able to make a magnificent marriage,
if she could be controlled. The greater the
prize, the greater the anxiety until it is
grasped.</p>

<p>When she tried on that first long dress of
hers she came in to show herself off to me.
She has never been in the least afraid of me&mdash;there
is a fine, utter courage looking from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
her eyes&mdash;an assurance that she could not be
afraid of any one or anything.</p>

<p>She turned round slowly, that I might get
the full effect. &#8220;Well, well!&#8221; said I, put into
a tolerant mood by my pride in her. &#8220;Aurora
had better keep you out of Horton&#8217;s sight
until after the ceremony.&#8221;</p>

<p>She tossed her head. &#8220;He&#8217;d be safe from
me if there wasn&#8217;t another man in the world,&#8221;
she answered.</p>

<p>I frowned on this. &#8220;You&#8217;ll have a hard
time making as good a marriage as your sister,
miss,&#8221; said I. &#8220;You&#8217;ll see, when we begin to
look for a husband for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall look for my own husband, thank
you,&#8221; she replied, pertly.</p>

<p>But her smile was so bright that I only said,
&#8220;We&#8217;ll cross that bridge, miss, when we come
to it&mdash;we&#8217;ll cross it together.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was an unpleasant silence&mdash;her expression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
made me feel more strongly than ever
before that she would be troublesome. I said:
&#8220;How old are you now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, don&#8217;t you remember? I was sixteen
last Wednesday. You gave me <i>this</i>.&#8221;
She touched a pearl brooch at her neck.</p>

<p>No, I didn&#8217;t remember&mdash;Ridley attends to
all those little matters for me. But I said,
&#8220;To be sure,&#8221; and patted her on the shoulder&mdash;and
let her kiss me, and then sent her away.
For a moment I envied the men whose humble
station enables them to enjoy more of such
intercourse as that. I confess I have my
moments when all this striving and struggling
after money and power seems miserably unsatisfactory,
and I picture myself and my
fellow strugglers as so many lunatics in a
world full of sane people whom we toil for and
give a bad quarter of an hour now and then
as our lunacy becomes violent.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>But that is a passing mood.</p>

<p>The next I heard of Helen she had set the
whole house in an uproar. Two days before
the wedding she shut herself in her apartment
and sent out word by her maid that she would
not be maid of honour&mdash;would not attend the
wedding. &#8220;I can do nothing with her,&#8221; said
my wife; &#8220;she&#8217;s been beyond my control for
two years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go to her,&#8221; I said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see who&#8217;s
master in this house.&#8221;</p>

<p>She herself opened her sitting-room door
for me. She had a book in her hand and was
apparently calm and well prepared. The look
in her eyes made me think of what my wife
had once said to me: &#8220;Be careful how you try
to bully her, James. She&#8217;s like you&mdash;and
Jim.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this I hear about you refusing to
appear in your first long dress?&#8221; I asked&mdash;a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
very different remark, I&#8217;ll admit, from the
one I intended to open with.</p>

<p>She smiled faintly, but did not take her serious
eyes from mine. &#8220;I can&#8217;t go to the wedding,&#8221;
said she. &#8220;Please, father, don&#8217;t ask it!
I&mdash;I hoped they wouldn&#8217;t tell you. I told
them they might say I was ill.&#8221;</p>

<p>I managed to look away from her and collect
my thoughts. &#8220;You are the youngest,&#8221; I
began, &#8220;and we have been foolishly weak with
you. But the time has come to bring you
under control and save you from your own
folly. Understand me! You will go to the
wedding, and you will go as maid of honour.&#8221;
I was master of myself again and I spoke the
last words sternly, and was in the humour for
a struggle. She had roused one of my strongest
passions&mdash;the passion for breaking wills
that oppose mine.</p>

<p>There was a long pause, and then she said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
quietly: &#8220;Very well, father. I shall obey
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was like a man who has flung himself with
all his might against what he thinks is a powerful
obstacle and finds himself sprawling
ridiculously upon vacancy. I lost my temper.
&#8220;What do you mean,&#8221; I exclaimed, angrily,
&#8220;by making all this fuss about nothing? You
will go at once and apologise to your mother
and sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sat silent, her eyes down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you hear?&#8221; I demanded.</p>

<p>She fixed her gaze steadily on mine. &#8220;Yes,
sir,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;but I cannot obey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How dare you say that to me?&#8221; I said, so
furious that I was calm. I had a sense of impotence&mdash;as
if the irresistible force had struck
the immovable body.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because what you ask isn&#8217;t right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget that I am your father.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>&#8220;And you forget that I am&#8221;&mdash;she drew herself
up proudly and looked at me unafraid&mdash;&#8220;your
daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>There seems to be some sort of magic in her.
I can&#8217;t understand it myself, but her answer
completely changed my feeling toward her.
It had never before occurred to me that the
fact of her being my daughter gave her rights
and privileges which would be intolerable in
another. I saw family pride for the first time
and instantly respected it. &#8220;If I only had a
son like you!&#8221; I said, on impulse, for the moment
forgetting everything else in this new
conception of family line and its meaning.</p>

<p>The tears rushed to her eyes. She leaned
forward in her eagerness. &#8220;You <i>had</i>&mdash;you
<i>have</i>,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Oh, father&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not another word,&#8221; I said, sternly; &#8220;why
did you refuse to go to Aurora&#8217;s wedding?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tuesday night she came into my room and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
got into my bed. She put her arms round me
and said, &#8216;Helen, I <i>can&#8217;t</i> marry him! He&#8217;s&mdash;he&#8217;s
just <i>awful</i>! It makes me cold all over for
him to touch me.&#8217; We talked nearly all night&mdash;and&mdash;I
feel sorry for her&mdash;but I felt it
would be wrong for me to go to the wedding
or have anything to do with it. She wouldn&#8217;t
break it off&mdash;she said she&#8217;d go on if it killed
her. And I begged her to go to you and ask
you to stop it, but she said she wanted to marry
him or she wouldn&#8217;t. And&mdash;but when you
said I must go, it seemed to me it&#8217;d be wrong
to disobey. Only&mdash;I can&#8217;t apologise to them&mdash;I
can&#8217;t&mdash;because&mdash;I&#8217;ve done nothing to
apologise for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, child,&#8221; I said&mdash;I felt thoroughly
uncomfortable. It is impossible clearly
to explain many matters to an innocent
mind. &#8220;You need not apologise. But pay no
attention to Aurora&#8217;s hysterics&mdash;and enjoy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
yourself at the wedding. Girls always act
absurdly when they&#8217;re about to marry. Six
months from now she&#8217;ll be the happiest woman
in New York, and if she didn&#8217;t marry him
she&#8217;d be the most wretched.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Aurora!&#8221; said Helen, with a long
sigh.</p>

<p>But Helen could not have said &#8220;poor&#8221; Aurora
on the great day at St. Bartholomew&#8217;s.
It was, indeed, an hour of triumph for us all.
As she and Kirkby came down from the altar,
I glanced round the church and had one of my
moments of happiness. There they all were&mdash;all
the pride and fashion and established
wealth of New York&mdash;all of them at my feet.
I, who had sprung from nothing; I, who had
had to fight, fight, fight, staking everything&mdash;yes,
character, even liberty itself&mdash;here was I,
enthroned, equal to the highest, able to put my
heel upon the necks of those who had regarded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
me as part of the dirt under their feet. I went
down the aisle of the church, drunk with pride
and joy. I had not had such happiness since
that day when, smarting under Judson&#8217;s insults,
I suddenly remembered that, if he had
honour, I had the million and was a millionaire.
As my wife and I drove back to the
house for the reception, I caught myself muttering
to the crowds pushing indifferently
along the sidewalks, intent upon their foolish
little business, &#8220;Bow! Bow! Don&#8217;t you
know that one of your masters is passing?&#8221;</p>

<p>Just as I was in the full swing of this ecstasy
I happened to notice a huge stain on the
costly cream-coloured lining of the brougham&mdash;I
was in my wife&#8217;s carriage. &#8220;What&#8217;s
that?&#8221; said I, pointing to it.</p>

<p>She told a silly story of how she had carelessly
broken a bottle in the carriage a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
days before and had ruined a seven-hundred-dollar
dress and the carriage-lining.</p>

<p>Instantly the routine of my life claimed me&mdash;my
happiness was over. I made the natural
comment upon such criminal indifference to
the cost of things; she retorted after her irrational,
irresponsible fashion. We were soon
quarrelling fiercely upon the all-important
subject, money, which she persists in denouncing
as vulgar. We could scarcely compose our
faces to leave the carriage and make a proper
appearance before the crowds without the
house and the throngs within. As for me, my
day was ruined.</p>

<p>But the reception was, in fact, a failure,
though it seemed a success. Aurora, the excitement
of the ceremony over, was looking
wretched; and, as she came down to go away,
her face was tragical. I could feel the hypocritical
whisperings of my guests. Exasperated,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
I turned, only to stumble on Helen, crying
as if her heart were breaking. My new
son-in-law bade me good-bye with a cold, condescending
shake of the hand, and in a voice
that made me long to strike him. It set me to
gnawing again on what Helen heard at the
dancing class three years ago. When every one
had gone my wife came to me, her eyes
sparkling with anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you see old Mrs. Kirkby leave?&#8221; she
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;she must have gone without speaking
to me,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;She left less than a minute after Aurora
and Horton. When I put out my hand to her
she just touched it with the tips of her fingers,
and all she said was, &#8216;I hope we&#8217;ll run across
each other at my son&#8217;s, some time.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll change their tune when I get after
them!&#8221; I exclaimed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>&#8220;What can <i>you</i> do?&#8221; sneered my wife.
&#8220;They know your money goes to Walter. Besides,
it&#8217;s all your fault.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>My</i> fault?&#8221; I said, in disgust&mdash;everything
is always my fault, according to my wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;it&#8217;s your reputation,&#8221; she retorted,
bitterly. &#8220;It&#8217;ll take two generations of respectability
to live it down.&#8221;</p>

<p>I left the room abruptly. The injustice of
this was so hideous that reply was impossible.
After all my sacrifices, after all my stupendous
achievements, after lifting my family
from obscurity to the highest dignity&mdash;<i>this</i>
was my reward! Yes, the highest dignity. I
know how they sneer. I know how they whisper
the ugly word that Helen heard at the
dancing class. I see it in their eyes when I
take them unawares. But&mdash;they cringe before
me, they fear me, and they dare not
offend me. What more could I ask? What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
do I care about their cowardly mutterings
which they dare not let me hear?</p>

<p>In the upper hall I came upon Helen, sitting
in the alcove, sobbing. &#8220;Poor Aurora!
Poor Aurora!&#8221; she said, when I paused before
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Aurora!&#8221; I retorted, angrily. &#8220;Your
sister is married to one of the richest men in
New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He tried to kiss me as they were leaving,&#8221;
she went on, between sobs, &#8220;and I drew away
and slapped him. When Aurora hugged me
she whispered, &#8216;I don&#8217;t blame you&mdash;I detest
him!&#8217; Poor Aurora!&#8221;</p>

<p>I went into my apartment and slammed the
door. I knew how it would turn out, and this
hysterical nonsense infuriated me.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_218.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;<i>I came upon Helen, sitting in the alcove, sobbing.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>When Aurora and Kirkby came back from
their trip through the South and burst in on
us at lunch [it was a Sunday], probably I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
the only one at the table who wasn&#8217;t surprised
by their looks. Helen, I knew, had been expecting
Aurora would return with a face like
the last scene of the last act of a tragedy. Instead
she was radiant, beautifully dressed, and
with an assurance of manner that was immensely
becoming to her&mdash;the assurance of a
woman who is conscious of having married
brilliantly and is determined to enjoy her good
fortune to the uttermost. It was plain that
she was on the best possible terms with Kirkby.
As for him, he looked foolishly happy and was
obviously completely under her control, as I
knew he would be. He is certainly in himself
not a dignified figure&mdash;short and fat and sallow
and amazingly ordinary-looking for a man
of such birth and breeding. But the instant
people hear who he is, they forget his face,
figure, and mind. In this world, what things
really are is not important; it&#8217;s altogether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
what they seem to be, altogether the valuation
agreed upon. I&#8217;ve sometimes watched the
children at their games, &#8220;playing&#8221; that pins
and rags have fantastic big values; and I&#8217;ve
thought how ridiculous it was to smile at them
and keep serious faces over our own grown-up
game of precisely the same kind.</p>

<p>Aurora had been sending home the newspapers
of every town in which they had
stopped, so we had a pretty good idea of the
ovation they had received. But as soon as she
was alone with us she went over it all&mdash;and we
were as proud as was she. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think Horton
liked it particularly, but there wasn&#8217;t a
place where they didn&#8217;t know more about me
than about him,&#8221; said she. &#8220;You noticed,
didn&#8217;t you, that the papers often said, &#8216;James
Galloway&#8217;s daughter and her husband&#8217;? Horton
was awfully funny about the excitement
over us. At first he kept up the pretence with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
me that he thought it vulgar. But he soon cut
that out and fairly devoured the newspapers.
Of course we didn&#8217;t drop our exclusiveness
before people&mdash;everywhere they talked about
how anxious we were to avoid notoriety.
Whenever the reporters came near us, my!
but didn&#8217;t Horton sit on them.&#8221;</p>

<p>She made only one criticism of him&mdash;and
that a laughing one. &#8220;You thought,&#8221; said she,
&#8220;that we started in a private car. Well, we
didn&#8217;t. When I got to Jersey City he put me
into a stuffy old regular Pullman with all sorts
of people. And he said, with the grandest air,
&#8216;I took the drawing-room, as I thought you&#8217;d
like privacy.&#8217; I saw that it was my time to
assert myself.&#8221; She laughed. &#8220;We had a little
talk,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;and at Philadelphia he
rushed round and got a private car.&#8221;</p>

<p>She soon brought his mother to terms. Mrs.
Kirkby called on my wife three days after they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
got back, and took her driving the following
afternoon. That drive is one of the important
events in my career. It marks the completion
of my conquest of New York. Thinking it
over, I decided to double Aurora&#8217;s portion under
my will. Next to Judson, she has been the
most useful person to me&mdash;no, not next to
Judson, but without exception. I should have
got my million-dollar start somehow, if I had
never seen him; but I should have had some
difficulty in reaching my climax if I had not
had Aurora.</p>

<p>My flood-tide of luck held through one more
event&mdash;the settlement with Natalie.</p>

<p>Naturally, I had put a good deal of thought
upon this problem. The longer I considered
it the more clearly I realised that to give her
anything at all would be an act of sheer generosity,
perhaps of dangerous generosity. As
I have said before, it did not take me long to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
absolve myself from the impossible letter of
my promise. If I had been capable of keeping
a promise to give six million dollars&mdash;the
sum necessary to produce &#8220;<i>an</i> income of a
quarter of a million&#8221;&mdash;to a person whom it
was absolutely vital to have financially dependent
upon me, I should have accomplished
very little in the world. At first my decision
to keep the spirit of my promise by giving
&#8220;<i>the</i> income of a quarter of a million&#8221; seemed
as fair as it was liberal. But now that she was
safely married to my son, I began to see that
to give her anything would be to strike a blow
at his domestic happiness, and that would
mean striking a blow at her own happiness.
It could not fail to unsettle her mind to find
herself with an independent income of ten or
twelve thousand a year in addition to the five
or six thousand she already had. Nothing else
is so certain to destroy a husband&#8217;s influence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
or to unfit a wife contentedly to fill her proper
place in the family as for her to be financially
independent.</p>

<p>I have never been lacking in the courage to
do right, no matter what moral quibble or personal
unpleasantness has stood in the way. I
resolved not to give her anything outright,
but, instead, to provide for her in my will&mdash;the
income of a quarter of a million, to be hers
for life, unless Walter should die and she
marry again.</p>

<p>There now remained only the comparatively
simple matter of reconciling her to this arrangement
when she was expecting at once to
receive the equivalent of six millions, free from
conditions.</p>

<p>A weak man would have put off the issue
until the last moment, through dislike of disagreeable
scenes. But I am not one of those
who aggravate difficulties by postponing them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
The day after Walter and Natalie sailed from
the other side for the homeward journey, I
sent for her father. &#8220;Matt,&#8221; said I, &#8220;as you
probably remember, I made up my mind to do
something for your daughter as soon as she
decided to become my daughter, too. I finally
got round to it this morning. I thought I&#8217;d
tell you I had made the necessary changes in
my will.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at me narrowly, with an expression
between wonder and suspicion. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
understand,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;I promised your daughter she should have
the income of a quarter of a million,&#8221; I replied,
&#8220;and this morning I put the necessary
provision into my will.&#8221;</p>

<p>His mouth dropped open. He wiped his
forehead with his handkerchief several times.
Then all of a sudden he flushed a violent red
and struck the table with his fist. &#8220;Why,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
damn it, Galloway,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;you promised
her you&#8217;d settle <i>an</i> income of a quarter of
a million on her at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked at him as if I thought him crazy.
&#8220;Where did you get that notion?&#8221; said I. &#8220;I
never heard of anything so preposterous. Did
you think I&#8217;d gone stark mad?&#8221; I let him see
that I was getting angry.</p>

<p>&#8220;She told me so&mdash;told me within an hour
of your promising it,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;And, by
heavens, you&#8217;ll stick to your promise!&#8221; He
banged the table with his fist again.</p>

<p>As I had made clear my intention&mdash;which
was my only purpose for that first interview&mdash;I
rose. &#8220;I permit no man to talk to me in that
fashion,&#8221; said I; &#8220;not even an old friend who
has apparently gone out of his mind. I do
not care to discuss the matter further.&#8221;</p>

<p>I went into my inner office and shut him
out. I knew he was too practical a man ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
really to have believed that I intended to give
his daughter any such stupendous sum. I was
certain he had pretended to her that he believed it,
because he was as eager for her to
marry Walter as I was. Assuming that he
did believe it, he could not but see there was
nothing but disaster for him in offending me.
Therefore, I had not the slightest fear that he
would persist in his anger; I knew he would
calm down, would at most cook up some
scheme for trying to frighten some sort of a
settlement out of me, and would break the
news to his daughter at the first opportunity,
so that he might caution her against doing
anything foolish on impulse.</p>

<p>I heard nothing from him and did not see
him again until we all went down to the dock
to meet Walter and Natalie. The exchange
of greetings between the two families was far
from cordial, her father and I barely nodding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
at each other. Natalie and her mother
and Walter went up-town together. I saw
that her mother could hardly wait to get
her alone so that she could tell her and
coach her.</p>

<p>I did not permit her to see me in circumstances
in which she could have talked freely
until nearly two weeks had passed. Then, her
friendly manner was rather strained, but she
said nothing about her settlement&mdash;and, of
course, I&#8217;m not the one to poke a sleeping dog.
I was delighted to find such a striking confirmation
of my good opinion of her. Doubtless
she doesn&#8217;t feel especially kindly toward
me, but she has given no sign&mdash;and that is the
important fact. A less intelligent woman
would not have seen how useless it was to make
a fight, or would have given way to her temper
just for the pleasure of relieving her feelings.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>To these two triumphs was now added a
third, which, in its many-sidedness, gave me
more satisfaction than either of the others.</p>

<p>It came in the course of my campaign to
push out of my industrial combination the
minor elements that had to be conciliated when
I was forming it. These were the little fellows
who were the chief original owners of the
various concerns of which it was composed.
They were no longer of the slightest use to the
industry; they were simply clinging to it, mere
parasites fattening upon my brains. I felt
that the time had come for shaking them off,
and forcing them to give up their holdings.
I needed every share either for my own investment
purposes or to bind to me the men I had
put in direct charge.</p>

<p>Having always had the shaking off of the
parasites in mind, I had never let the combination
develop its full earning capacity. As my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
first move toward complete possession, I
caused it to be given out that I was privately
much disappointed with the outlook for the
industry and for the combination, and was
thinking of disposing of my holdings quietly.
When this rumour that I was about to &#8220;unload&#8221;
was brought to my attention, I refused
either to confirm or to deny it. I followed this
with some slight manipulations of rates, prices,
and the stock market. I was, of course, careful
to do nothing violent. I never forget,
nowadays, that I am one of the bulwarks of
conservatism and stability; I and my fellow-occupants
of the field of high finance sternly
repress all the stock-raiding moves of the little
fellows who are struggling to get together in
a hurry the millions that would enable them to
break into our company.</p>

<p>My moves against my combination sent its
stock slowly down. The minority stockholders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
unloaded&mdash;the most timid upon the least
timid; then, as fear spread and infected the
most hopeful among them, all unloaded upon
the public. Finally, I gave the stock a hard
blow that sent it tumbling&mdash;almost openly I
sold ten thousand shares, and the sale was regarded
by the public as ominously significant,
because it was known that I no longer speculated,
and that I frowned upon speculation
and speculators. When I had gathered in
what I wanted, at bottom prices, I came to the
rescue, put up the price with a strong hand,
denounced those who had attacked it, expressed
my great faith in the future of the
industry and of my combination&mdash;and caught
in the net, along with a lot of <i>bona fide</i> sellers,
a vast shoal of wriggling and gasping speculators
in &#8220;shorts.&#8221;</p>

<p>The one of these fish that peculiarly interested
me was&mdash;my son Walter. I knew he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
would be there, and had known it since the
third week of my campaign. As I have never
permitted him to see into the machinery of my
financial plant, he fancied that he could operate
without my finding it out. But one of my
spies had brought the news to my chief brokers
when he placed his second selling order. I was
astonished that another son of mine had gone
into such low and stupid and even dishonourable
business&mdash;yes, dishonourable. My own
speculative operations were never of the petty
character and for the petty purposes that constitute
gambling. I sent at once for a transcript
of his bank account&mdash;a man in my position
must have at his command every possible
source of inside information and I have made
getting at bank accounts one of my specialties.
My astonishment became amazement when I
learned that four cash items in that account,
making in the total nearly the whole of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
gambling capital, were four checks for fifty
thousand dollars each&mdash;from his mother!</p>

<p>I had tried many times to get hold of her
bank account; but she, partly through craft,
partly through the perversity of luck, did business
with one of the banks into whose secrets
I had never been able to penetrate. I understand
at a glance where the two hundred thousand
had come from. They were her &#8220;commissions&#8221;
got from me by stealth, by juggling
household and personal accounts. I saw that
I had the opportunity to give Walter a vivid
lesson, to get back my money, and to reduce
my wife once more to a proper complete dependence.
So I talked business with Walter
a great deal during those three months, taking
always a gloomy view of prospects of my combination.
From time to time through my
spies I learned that he was eagerly taking advantage
of these &#8220;tips,&#8221; was plunging deeper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
and deeper in his betting that the stock of my
industrial would continue to fall. When I
suddenly put up the price of the stock, he was
on the wrong side of the market to the extent
of all his cash, and, like scores of other fools,
far beyond.</p>

<p>I went home to lunch on the day I hauled
in my net, for I wished to be where I could
brand the lesson indelibly upon my wife. I
had ordered my men to give out my strong
statement and to rocket the market not earlier
than a quarter past one and not later than half
past&mdash;our lunch hour. We had been at table
about ten minutes when my wife was called
away to the telephone. She was in high good-humour
as she left the room; indeed, for nearly
two months her confident hopes of profits
that would give her a million or more in her
own right had made her almost youthful in
looks and in spirits. She was gone a long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
time, so long that I was just sending for her
when she entered. The change in her was
shocking. For a moment I was alarmed lest
my lesson had been too severe.</p>

<p>Helen started up, upsetting her chair in her
fright at her mother&#8217;s grey old face. &#8220;Mother!&#8221;
she exclaimed, &#8220;what is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her mother tried to smile, but gave me a
frightened, cowed glance. &#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;I&#8217;m not
well all of a sudden,&#8221; she said. Then she
abruptly left the room, Helen following her.</p>

<p>As I and Ridley and Cress were smoking
our after-lunch cigars, she sent for me. I
found her alone in her darkened sitting-room,
lying on the lounge. She asked me to sit, and
then she began: &#8220;I wish to speak to you about&mdash;about
Walter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About his gambling?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>She did not move or speak for fully a minute.
It was so dark in her corner that I could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
not see her distinctly; besides, when I spoke,
she had quickly covered her face. At length
she said: &#8220;So you knew all the time? You set
this trap for&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Both of you,&#8221; I said, as I saw that she did
not intend to complete her sentence.</p>

<p>Presently she went on: &#8220;Then I needn&#8217;t explain.
What I want to say is&mdash;it&#8217;s all my
fault that Walter did it. He&#8217;s down at your
office now. He didn&#8217;t have a chance to cover,
the stock went up so fast. He&#8217;s lost everything,
and&mdash;but I suppose it&#8217;s to you that he&#8217;s
in debt. I&#8217;m sick&mdash;sick in body, and sick in
mind. I give up. I&#8217;ve made my last fight.
All I ask is&mdash;don&#8217;t punish him for what&#8217;s all
my fault.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your fault?&#8221; said I, my curiosity roused.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wished to be free,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;I
wished them to be free. I tried through
James when I saw how certain it was he could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
never get on with you. Then I tried through
Walter when I saw how you were crushing
him and Natalie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you set James to gambling?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;and I&#8217;d have confessed, but there
were the other children just at the age when
they most needed me to protect them from
you. And&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;couldn&#8217;t. Besides, he
begged me not to&mdash;and there was his forgery.
I never thought he had it in him to do
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he was <i>your</i> son,&#8221; said I, &#8220;and he had
<i>your</i> example. He knew how you got the
money you gave him&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t! don&#8217;t&mdash;please don&#8217;t!&#8221; she
wailed, breaking down altogether. &#8220;If you
could see yourself as others, as my children
and I see you, you&#8217;d understand&mdash;No! No!
I don&#8217;t mean that. Forgive me&mdash;and don&#8217;t
punish Walter for my sins.&#8221; She burst into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
such a wild passion of sobs and tears that I
rang for her maid, and, when she came, left to
go down-town.</p>

<p>In my office sat Walter, looking dejected,
but far from the sorry figure I had expected
to see. He followed me into my
inside room and stood near my desk, his eyes
down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sir!&#8221; said I, sternly. In fact, I was
not the least bit angry; my complete victory,
and the recovery of my control over my family
had put me in a serene frame of mind.
&#8220;Your mother has told me everything,&#8221; I
added, not wishing him to irritate me with
any lies.</p>

<p>&#8220;But she doesn&#8217;t know everything,&#8221; said
he, &#8220;I risked half of Natalie&#8217;s money&mdash;and&mdash;I&mdash;her
father loaned me two hundred thousand.&#8221;</p>

<p>I frowned still more heavily to conceal the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
satisfaction this news gave me. &#8220;Did Bradish
know what you were going to do with the
money?&#8221; I demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Walter, in a voice that must
have come out of a desert-dry throat. &#8220;He&mdash;he
went twenty thousand shares short on his
own account.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was better and better. For the first
time in years I felt like laughing aloud.
&#8220;You didn&#8217;t by any chance draw Kirkby in?&#8221;
I asked, with a pretence of sarcasm.</p>

<p>Walter shook his head. &#8220;No&mdash;Kirkby
doesn&#8217;t care about stocks.&#8221;</p>

<p>That gave me a chance to laugh. But it
wasn&#8217;t a kind of laughter that Walter found
contagious. If anything, he got a few shades
whiter. &#8220;I&#8217;ve known you were in this for two
months and a half,&#8221; said I. &#8220;I wished to give
you an object-lesson that would make you appreciate
why Kirkby doesn&#8217;t care about stocks.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
I&#8217;ve known every move you made&mdash;we who
rule down here always know about the small
people, about the idiots like you. We are
rarely able to fool each other; what chance
have you and your kind got? I told you all
this, and now I&#8217;ve taught it to you. I&#8217;ve not
decided on your punishment yet. But one
thing I can tell you: if you ever go into the
market again, you will&mdash;join your ex-brother!&#8221;</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment, then began:
&#8220;Mother&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know about her,&#8221; I interrupted. &#8220;I wish
to hear nothing from you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He straightened himself and looked at me
for the first time. &#8220;She telephoned me she
was going to take all the blame,&#8221; he said, resolutely.
&#8220;It isn&#8217;t true that she led me into this.
I started with my own money, then added
Natalie&#8217;s, then some from Mr. Bradish, and it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
wasn&#8217;t until then that I went to mother and
induced her to risk her money.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was astonished at the manliness of his look
and tone&mdash;as unlike him as possible. &#8220;Marriage
seems to have improved you,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;it&#8217;s Natalie,&#8221; he replied, his face taking
on the foolish look a man gets when he is
under the thumb of some woman. &#8220;She&#8217;s
very different from what we thought&mdash;or
from what she thought herself. She&#8217;s made
me into a new sort of man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A stock gambler?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>He reddened, but knew better than to show
his teeth at me, when he was, if possible, more
dependent than ever before.</p>

<p>&#8220;A fine story you tell for your mother,&#8221; I
went on; &#8220;but she told me everything&mdash;about
James, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If she says she led James into speculating,
that wasn&#8217;t so, either,&#8221; he replied, and again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
his voice was honest. &#8220;Jim was deep in the
hole, and she tried to help him out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how do you happen to know so much
about James and his speculating?&#8221; I asked,
sharply.</p>

<p>His eyes dropped and he began to shift
from leg to leg in his old despicable fashion.
&#8220;I&mdash;know,&#8221; he said, doggedly.</p>

<p>But I wasn&#8217;t interested in James&mdash;or, for
that matter, in the comparative guilt of Walter
and his mother. I had no more time to
give to the affair. I sent Walter away, after
repeating my warning as to the consequences
of another lapse, and then I gave my whole
attention to business&mdash;to punishing the other
wretched &#8220;shorts&#8221; and to putting on full
steam throughout my combination, mine now
in its entirety and therefore ready for the utmost
development of its earning power.</p>

<p>Six months later&mdash;that is, last week&mdash;I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
doubled the outstanding capital stock and at
the same time increased the dividend from five
per cent. to six. It is now earning forty-two
per cent. on my total actual investment&mdash;a
satisfactory property, quite up to my expectations.</p>

<p>My wife has gone abroad with Helen.
Poor woman! She has never been the same
since her dream collapsed. However, she no
longer irritates or opposes me. And Natalie
is the most satisfactory of daughters-in-law,
and Walter the most docile of sons. As for
Aurora, I have been unexpectedly able to get
a hold upon her, and through her upon Kirkby.
She rules him in every matter except one.
He keeps her on short, absurdly short, supplies
for the household and her personal expenses.
&#8220;When I found that he carried a
change purse, I had a foreboding,&#8221; said she
to me the other day. &#8220;And when I saw how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
he looked as he opened it, took a nickel out
and closed it, I knew what I had to look forward
to.&#8221; I have raised her hopes for a large
allowance from me in the near future, and a
fortune under my will. Presently, through
my efforts, combined with hers, I think I shall
have Kirkby for a colossal undertaking I am
working out.</p>

<p>Altogether, my affairs are in a thoroughly
satisfactory condition. If it weren&#8217;t for old
age, and certain pains at times in the back of
my head&mdash;though they may be largely imaginary.
Then there is the matter of sleep. I
haven&#8217;t had a night&#8217;s sleep in seven years, and
for the last year I have had only three hours&#8217;,
pieced out with a nap in my carriage on the
way up-town.</p>

<p>&#8220;Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.&#8221;
But&mdash;it wears a crown!</p>

<p>When I began to build my palace in New
York City, in Fifth Avenue near Fifty-ninth
Street, I intended it to be the seat of
my family for many generations. My architect
obeyed my orders and planned the most
imposing residence in the city; but, before
it was finished&mdash;indeed, before we had any
considerable amount of furniture collected
for it&mdash;no less than seven palaces were under
way, each excelling mine in every respect&mdash;in
extent, in costliness of site and structure,
in taste, and in spaciousness of interior arrangement.
This was mortifying, for it
warned me that within a few years my palace
would be completely, even absurdly, in
eclipse, for it would stand among towering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
flat-houses and hotels&mdash;a second-class neighbourhood.</p>

<p>But, irritating and expensive though the
lesson was, it was of inestimable value to me
with my ability to see and to profit. It taught
me my own ignorance and so set me to educating
myself in matters most important to
the dignity of my family line. Also it taught
me how I was underestimating New York and
its expansive power, and therefore the expansive
power of the whole country. I began to
acquire large amounts of real estate which
have already vindicated my judgment; and I
made bolder and more sweeping moves in my
industrial and railway developments&mdash;those
moves that have frightened many of my associates.
Naturally, to the short-sighted, the
far-sighted seem visionary. A man may stake
his soul, or even his life, on something beyond
his vision, and therefore, to him, visionary;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
but he won&#8217;t stake enough of his money in it
seriously to impair his fortune if he loses.
That&#8217;s why large success is only for the far-sighted.</p>

<p>While I was debating the palace problem,
along came the craze for country establishments
near New York&mdash;palaces set in the
midst of parks. I was suspicious of this apparently
serious movement among the people
of my class, for I knew that at bottom we
Americans of all classes are a show-off people&mdash;that
is, are human. Only the city can furnish
the crowd we want as a background for
our prosperity and as spectators of it; we are
not content with the gaping of a few undiscriminating,
dull hayseeds. We like intelligent
gaping&mdash;the kind that can come pretty
near to putting the price-marks on houses,
jewels, and dresses. We&#8217;d put them there
ourselves, even the most &#8220;refined&#8221; of us, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
custom, made, by the way, by the poor people
with their so-called culture, did not forbid it.
So, though I was too good a judge of business
matters to have much faith in the country-house
movement, I bought &#8220;Ocean Farm&#8221; and
planned my house there on a vast scale. It is,
as a little study of it will reveal, ingeniously
arranged, so that, if the country-seat fashion
shall ever revive, it can be expanded
without upsetting proportions, and splendid
improvements can easily be made in the
handsome, five-hundred-acre park which surrounds
it.</p>

<p>But just as I was taking up the problem of
an establishment for Walter, the shrewdness
of my doubts about the country began to appear.
I had been investing in real estate in
and near upper Fifth Avenue; I determined
to build myself a new palace there that would
be monumental. It will never be possible for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
a private establishment in New York to cover
more surface than a block, so I fixed on and
bought the entire block between &mdash;&mdash; and
&mdash;&mdash; Streets and Fifth and Madison Avenues.
Then I ordered my architect to drop everything
else and spend a year abroad in careful
study of the great houses of Europe, both old
and new. This detailing of a distinguished
architect for a year might seem to be an extravagance;
in fact, it was one of those wise
economies which are peculiarly characteristic
of me.</p>

<p>Money spent upon getting the best possible
in the best possible way is never extravagance.
People incapable of thinking in large sums do
not see that to lay out five millions economically
one must adopt methods proportionately
broader than those one would use in laying
out five thousand or five hundred thousand to
the best advantage. It has cost me hundreds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
of thousands, perhaps millions, to learn that
lesson.</p>

<p>I sent a man from my office along with my
architect to act as an auditor for his expense
accounts, and to see that he did his work conscientiously
and did not use my money and
my purchase of his time in junketing &#8220;<i>au
grand prince</i>.&#8221; In addition to planning the
palace, he was to settle upon interior decorations
and to buy pictures, tapestries, carvings,
furniture, etc., etc.&mdash;of course, making no important
purchases without consulting me by
cable. I believe he never did a harder year&#8217;s
work in his life&mdash;and I&#8217;m not easily convinced
as to what I haven&#8217;t seen with my own eyes.</p>

<p>When he came home and submitted the results
of his tour, I myself took them abroad
and went over them with the authorities on
architecture and decoration in Paris. It was
two years before the final plan was ready for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
execution. In those two years I had learned
much&mdash;so much that my palace near Fifty-ninth
Street, which I had imagined the acme
of art and splendour when I accepted its final
plans, had become to me an intolerable flaunting
of ignorance and tawdriness. I had intended
still to retain it as the hereditary residence
for the heirs-apparent of my line, and,
when they should succeed to the headship of
the family, the so-to-speak dowager-residence.
But my education had made this impossible.
I was impatient for the moment to arrive
when I could sell it, or tear it down, and put
in place of it a flat-house for people of moderate
wealth, or a first-class hotel.</p>

<p>Three years and a half from the sailing of
my architect in quest of ideas I took possession
of the completed palace. First and last I had
spent nearly five millions and a half upon it;
I was well content with the result. Nor has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
the envious chatter of alleged critics in this
country disturbed me. There will be scores of
houses as costly, and many as imposing, before
fifty years have passed; but, until there is a
revolution in the art of building, there will be
none more dignified, more conspicuous, or
more creditable. I flatter myself that, as
money is spent, I got at least two dollars of
value for every dollar I paid out. I wished
to build for the centuries, and I am confident
that I have accomplished my purpose. Only
an earthquake or a rain of ruin from the sky
or a flood of riot can overthrow my handiwork.</p>

<p>But to go back a little. Just as we were
about to move, my wife and Ridley died within
a few days of each other. At first these deaths
were a severe shock to me, as, aside from the
sad, yet after all inevitable, parting, there was
the prospect of the complete disarrangement
of my domestic plans, and at a highly inconvenient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
moment. But, thanks to my unfailing
luck, my fears proved groundless. Helen
came splendidly to the rescue and displayed at
once an executive ability that more than filled
the gap. My plans for the change of residence,
for the expansion of the establishment,
and for my own comfort&mdash;everything went
forward smoothly, far more smoothly than I
had hoped when my wife and Ridley were
alive and part of my calculation.</p>

<p>At first blush it may seem rather startling,
but I missed poor old Ridley far more than I
missed my wife. A moment&#8217;s consideration,
however, will show that this was neither
strange nor unnatural. For twenty years he
was my constant companion whenever I was
not at work down-town. During those twenty
years I had seen little of my wife except in the
presence of others, usually some of them not
members of my family. Whenever we were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
alone, it was for the despatch of more or less
disagreeable business. She had her staff of
servants, I mine; she had her interests, I
mine. Wherever our interests met, they
clashed.</p>

<p>I think she was a thoroughly unhappy
woman&mdash;as every woman must be who does
not keep to the privacy and peace of the home.
I looked at her after she had been dead a few
hours, and was impressed by the unusualness
of the tranquillity of her face. It vividly recalled
her in the days when we lived in the
little house in the side street away down-town
and talked over our business and domestic
affairs every night before going to sleep.
After the first few years and until almost the
end she was a great trial to me. But I have
no resentment. Indeed, now that she is gone
I feel inclined to concede that she was not so
much to blame as are these absurd social conditions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
that tempt women to yield to their
natural folly and give them power to harass
and hamper men.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m inclined to despair of marriage, at least
so far as we of the upper and dominating, and
example-setting, class are concerned. With us
what basis of common interest is there left between
husband and wife? He has his large
business affairs which wholly absorb him,
which do not interest her&mdash;indeed, which he
would on no account permit her small, uninformed
mind to meddle in. With all his energy
and all his intelligence enlisted elsewhere,
what time or interest has he for home and
wife? And to her he seems dull, an infliction
and a bore. Nor has she any interest at home&mdash;governesses,
a housekeeper, an army of servants
do her work for her. So far as I can
see, except as a means whereby a woman may
disport herself in mischief-breeding luxury<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
and laziness, marriage has no rational excuse
for persisting.</p>

<p>It was with genuine regret that I was compelled
to deny my wife&#8217;s last request. I say
&#8220;deny,&#8221; but I was, of course, far too generous
and considerate to torment her in her last moments.
When she made up her mind that the
doctors and nurses were deceiving her and
that she wasn&#8217;t to get well, she asked for me.
When we were alone, she said: &#8220;James, I wish
to see our son&mdash;I wish <i>you</i> to send for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>I did not pretend to misunderstand her. I
knew she meant James. As she was very
feeble, and barely conscious, she was in no
condition to decide for herself. It was a time
for me to be gentle; but there is never a time
for weakness. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; I said, humouring her,
&#8220;I will have him sent for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish <i>you</i> to send for him, James,&#8221; she
insisted; &#8220;send right away.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said I, &#8220;I&#8217;ll send for him.&#8221;
And I rose as if to obey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go just yet,&#8221; she went on; &#8220;there&#8217;s
something more.&#8221;</p>

<p>I sat in silence so long that I began to think
she was asleep or unconscious. But finally she
spoke: &#8220;I got Walter&#8217;s permission this morning.
James, if I tell you of a great wrong he
has done, a very great wrong, will you forgive
him for my sake?&#8221;</p>

<p>I thought over her request. Finally I said,
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at me,&#8221; she went on. Our eyes met.
&#8220;Say it again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I will forgive him,&#8221; I said, and I
meant it&mdash;unless the wrong should prove to be
one of those acts for which forgiveness is impossible.</p>

<p>She turned her face away, then said, slowly,
each word coming with an effort: &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
James who forged your name. It was Walter.&#8221;</p>

<p>I felt enormously relieved, for, while I
shouldn&#8217;t have hesitated to break my promise
had it been wise to do so, I am a man who holds
his word sacred even to his own hurt, provided
it is not also to the jeopardy of vital affairs.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not surprised,&#8221; said I. &#8220;It is like Walter
to hide behind any one foolish enough to shield
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;he&#8217;s not that way any more,&#8221; she
pleaded, her passion for shielding her children
from my justice as strong as ever. &#8220;He told
me long ago&mdash;when you caught him in that
speculation. And we talked it over and then
we went to see James, and he insisted that we
shouldn&#8217;t tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;What reason did he
give?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He said he had made his life and you yours,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
and that he knew you didn&#8217;t want to be disturbed
any more than he did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was right,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>The forgery has long ceased to be important.
James and his wife, with their wholly
different ideas and methods, could not possibly
be remoulded now to my purposes. I have
educated Walter and Natalie to the headship
of the family; I&#8217;ve neither time nor inclination
to take up a couple of strangers and
make an arduous and extremely dubious experiment.</p>

<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; my wife went on, &#8220;I ask you to send
for James. I wish to see him restored to what
is rightfully his before I die.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll send for him,&#8221; said I. &#8220;It may take a
little time, as he is out of town. But be patient,
and I&#8217;ll send for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>I learned that I had spoken more truthfully
than I knew. He was camping with his wife<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
in the depths of the Adirondacks, several days
away from the mails. The next day I told
Cress to write him a letter saying I&#8217;d interpose
no objection if he should try to see his mother,
who was ill. I ordered Cress to hold the letter
until the following day. But that night she
died. She was not fully conscious again after
her exhausting talk with me.</p>

<p>The evening of the day of the funeral I
took Walter into my sitting-room and repeated
to him what his mother had told me.
&#8220;But,&#8221; said I, &#8220;because I promised her, I forgive
you. It would have been more manly
had you confessed to me, but I&#8217;ve learned not
to expect the impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All I ask, sir,&#8221; said he, &#8220;is that you never
let Natalie know. She&#8217;d despise me&mdash;she&#8217;d
leave me.&#8221;</p>

<p>I could not restrain a smile at this absurd
exaggeration&mdash;at this delusion of vanity that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
he was the important factor with Natalie, and
not I and my property.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can say,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;that you have
changed your mind, and you needn&#8217;t give a
reason. And James can take my place, and,
believe me, she&#8217;ll not be at all surprised.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had no difficulty in believing him, for
Natalie&#8217;s experience with her dowry had no
doubt put her in the proper frame of mind for
any further change of plan I might happen to
make. I patted him on the shoulder. &#8220;I
promised your mother I&#8217;d forgive you,&#8221; said
I, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll fulfil my promise to the letter.
James is best off where he is, and, if you continue
to try to please, your prospects shall remain
as they are.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was overcome with gratitude and relief.
But he was presently trying to look sorry. &#8220;I
feel ashamed of myself,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can afford to,&#8221; I replied, drily. &#8220;It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
will cost you nothing. But I venture to suggest
that instead of pretending to quarrel with
good fortune, you would better be planning to
deserve it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two deaths&mdash;my wife&#8217;s and Ridley&#8217;s&mdash;coming
so close together made a profoundly
disagreeable impression upon me. My abhorrence
of &#8220;the end,&#8221; to which I have referred
several times, then definitely became a monomania
with me. The thought of &#8220;the end&#8221;
began to thrust itself upon me daily&mdash;or,
rather, nightly. I have never been a happy
man. Added to my natural incessant restlessness,
which always characterises a creative intellect,
and which has kept me as well as
every one around me in a state of irritation,
there is in me an absolute incapacity to live in
the present; and to be happy, I have long since
seen, one must live in the present. Occasionally,
when my fame or my power or my wealth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
has been suddenly and vividly revealed to me
in moments of triumph, I have lived in the
present for a little while. But soon the future,
its projects, its duties, its possibilities, have
stretched me on the rack again. As for the
much-talked-of happiness of anticipation, that
is possible only to children and childish persons.
When the battle is on&mdash;and when has
the battle not been on with me?&mdash;the general is
too busy to indulge in any anticipations of
victory. He has hardly time even for anxieties
about defeat.</p>

<p>I neglected to note, in its proper order, that
my wife willed all her jewels&mdash;a value of eight
hundred thousand dollars&mdash;to James. I consulted
my lawyer and found that through
carelessness, or, rather, through ignorance of
the law, I had given her a legal title to them,
a legal right to dispose of them by will. There
was nothing for it but to make the best bargain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
I could. After some roundabout negotiations
James declined my proposal that he
accept a cash valuation on fair appraisement.
He then indulged his passion for theatrical
sentimentality and declined the legacy beyond
a few trinkets worth hardly a thousand dollars,
I should say, which had belonged to his mother
in her girlhood and in the first years of her
married life. These Helen persuaded him to
divide with her. Aurora at first insisted on
having part of the jewels; but I wished to
keep them all for the direct succession, and so
induced her to take two hundred thousand
dollars for her claim&mdash;agreeing not to subtract
it from her share under my will. As she
is a satisfactory child, I consider the promise
binding.</p>

<p>I sold my old palace for two and a quarter
millions to a <i>parvenu</i>, dazzled by an accidental
half a dozen millions and impatient to show<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
them off before they vanished. While effecting
the merger of my three railways, I made
quadruple the balance of the cost of my new
palace, by extinguishing one minority interest
at forty-seven and creating another at one
hundred and two. Given the capital, it is incomparably
harder to build a palace than to
make a score of millions. A very crude sort
of man may get rich, but refinement and culture
and taste and custom of wealth and a sense
of the difference between dignity and ostentation
are required to enable a man to demonstrate
his fitness to possess wealth. I cannot
expect my envious contemporaries publicly to
admit that I have demonstrated my fitness.
But&mdash;future generations will vindicate me in
this as in other respects.</p>

<p>I kept a sharp look-out for a house for Walter&mdash;or,
rather, for the hereditary principal
heir of my line. Among the minority stockholders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
in one of my three railways was Edward
Haverford, grandson of that Haverford
who originated the secret freight rebate. By
the very timid use of it natural in a beginner,
and at a time when railway transportation
was in its infancy, he had accumulated several
millions. I doubt if he had any great amount
of brains. I know that his grandson is as
stupid as he is stingy. But he had a beautiful
little palace in East Seventieth Street, near
Fifth Avenue&mdash;an ideal home for a gentleman
with expectations, the scion of a great family.
In the &#8220;squeeze&#8221; incident to my extinguishing
the minority existing before the merger, Haverford
lost his fortune and was glad to dispose
of his house to me for a million in cash. I
established Walter and Natalie there and fixed
their allowance from me at eight thousand a
month. This is enough to enable them to live
in easy circumstances with an occasional grant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
from me&mdash;a happy compromise between an independence
that would be dangerous and a
dependence that would, in an heir-apparent,
seem undignified.</p>

<p>I have decided not to take them in to live
with me when Helen is married. I could not
endure the daily espionage of those who are
to succeed me. They could not conceal from
<i>my</i> eyes their impatience for me to be gone. I
shall keep them waiting many a year&mdash;seventy
is not old for any man. For a man of my
natural strength it is merely that advanced
period of middle life when one must make his
health his prime concern.</p>

<p>No, Helen shall stay on with me.</p>

<p>Her case is another instance of the folly of
anticipating trouble. From the day she came
to me with her confession that she had defied
me by going to James at the crisis of his illness,
I had been looking forward to a sharp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
collision with her. Naturally, I assumed that
the trouble would come over her marriage. I
pictured her falling in love with some nobody
with nothing and giving me great anxiety if
not humiliation; and, while my wife had a certain
amount of capacity in social matters, especially
in the last two or three years of her life,
I appreciated that she had many serious shortcomings.
Intellectually, she was so far inferior
to Helen that I could not but fear the
worst. I had been, therefore, impatient for
her to find a suitable husband for Helen, and
so put an end to the peril of a severe blow to
my pride and plans. As I had a peculiar
affection for Helen, it would have cut me to
the quick had she married beneath her.</p>

<p>I was luckier than I hoped. My wife disappointed
me by rising to the occasion. Old
Mrs. Kirkby, having accepted the alliance
with my family, proceeded to make the best of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
it. She took up my wife and Helen and put
them in her own set&mdash;it seems to me the dullest
in New York, if not in the world, but the most
envied, and is beyond question composed of
gentlefolk of the true patrician type. As my
wife was careful that Helen should meet no
one outside that set, and should go nowhere
without herself or Mrs. Kirkby in watchful
attendance, Helen was completely safeguarded
against acquaintance, however slight, with
any man of the wrong kind. So assiduous and
careful was my wife&mdash;thanks, no doubt, to
sagacious Mrs. Kirkby&#8217;s teaching and example!&mdash;that
she even never permitted Helen to
go either to Walter&#8217;s or to Aurora&#8217;s when
there were to be guests, without first making a
study of the list. This was a highly necessary
precaution, for both Natalie and Aurora, being
safely married, admitted to their houses
many persons who were all very well for purposes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
of amusement, but not their social equals
in the sense of eligibility to admission into an
upper-class family with a position to maintain.</p>

<p>As everybody knows, the Kuypers are one
of the best families in New York. When the
original Kirkby was clerk in a Whitehall
grocery before the Revolutionary War, a
Kuyper kept the grocery&mdash;an eminently respectable
business in those simple days. He
had inherited it from his grandfather, and also
a farm near where the Tombs prison now
stands. The Kuypers have been people of
means and of social and political and military
and naval distinction for a century. About a
year before my wife died she and Mrs. Kirkby
fixed upon Delamotte Kuyper for Helen;
and, although he was not rich, I approved
their selection. With his comfortable income
and what he will inherit and what I intend to
leave Helen, they will be well established. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
addition to family and position and rank as
the eldest son in the direct line, he has the advantages
of being a handsome fellow, a graduate
of Groton, a student at Harvard and at
Oxford, and one of those men who do all sorts
of gentlemen&#8217;s pastimes surpassingly well.
My wife was discreet in concealing her purpose
from Helen&mdash;so discreet that, when the climax
came, the poor child expected us to oppose the
marriage. She had heard me and her mother
comment often on Delamotte&#8217;s comparatively
small fortune and expectations&mdash;large for an
old New York family, but a mere nothing
among the fortunes of us newer and more
splendid aristocrats. A yachting trip in the
Mediterranean, and the business was done.</p>

<p>The yachting trip was my suggestion.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t recall ever having had a more agreeable
sensation than when she came to me just
after her return&mdash;poor Ridley was in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
room, I remember. She threw her arms round
my neck and said: &#8220;You dear splendid old
father! How happy you have made me.
There never was a luckier girl than I!&#8221;</p>

<p>That added half a million to what I&#8217;m leaving
her in my will.</p>

<p>What a pity, what a shame that she&#8217;s a
woman! She has my brains. She has my
courage. She has a noble character&mdash;yes, I
admire even her enthusiasms and sentimentalities.
She has all the qualifications for the succession
except one. There fate cheated me.</p>

<p>I have a sick feeling every time I think
what might have happened had James remained
in my family and been my principal
heir. There&#8217;s not the slightest doubt that he
would have upset all my plans as soon as I
was gone. He would have done his best to recreate
for my family the conditions of the old
America which made &#8220;three generations from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
shirt sleeves to shirt sleeves&#8221; proverbial. How
fortunate that he shouldered the blame for
Walter&#8217;s boyish folly! How fortunate that I
did not learn it at a time when I might have
been tempted to take him back! I was indeed
born under a lucky star.</p>

<p>A lucky star! And yet what have I ever
got out of it?&mdash;I, who have spent my life in
toil and sweat without a moment&#8217;s rest or happiness,
sacrificing myself to my future generations.
Sometimes I look at all these great
prizes which I have drawn and hold, and I
wonder whether they are of any value, after
all. But, valuable or worthless, it was they or
nothing, for what else is there beside wealth
and power and position?</p>

<p>Nothing!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is curious how the human mind works&mdash;curious
and terrible. Seven months after my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
wife&#8217;s death, when we had put aside the
mourning and had resumed our ordinary
course of life, I suddenly began to think of
her as I was shaving. &#8220;I wonder what
brought <i>her</i> into my mind?&#8221; said I to myself,
and I decided that my face with the white
stubble on its ridges had suggested my familiar
black devil&mdash;&#8220;the end.&#8221; But one day
several months later, as I was driving from
my office to lunch at a directors&#8217; meeting, I
happened to notice the lower part of my face
in the small mirror in the brougham.</p>

<p>My attention became riveted upon the line
of my mouth, thin and firm and straight&mdash;with
a queer sudden downward dip at the left
corner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Strange!&#8221; said I to myself; &#8220;I never noticed
<i>that</i> before.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then I remembered I <i>had</i> noticed it before,
<i>once</i> before and only once&mdash;the morning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
when I was shaving and thought of my
wife and &#8220;the end.&#8221; I had noticed it then and&mdash;had
I noticed it no morning since because it
had disappeared? Or had it been there all
along, and had my mind seen it and hidden
the fact from me? When one has a well-trained,
obedient mind, it can and will hide
from him almost anything he would find disagreeable
or inconvenient to know.</p>

<p>I tried to straighten that line, but, no matter
how I twisted my mouth, the drop at the left
corner remained. I caught sight of my eyes
in the mirror and found myself staring into
the depth of a Something which had thus
trapped me into letting it mock me. When
my carriage stopped at the Postal Telegraph
Building, I was so weak that I could hardly
drag myself across the sidewalk and into the
elevator. As I was shaving the next morning
I dared not look myself in the eyes. But there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
was the droop, and&mdash;yes&mdash;a droop of the left
eyelid! I gave an involuntary cry&mdash;the razor
cut me, and dropped to the floor. My valet
rushed in. &#8220;I&mdash;I only cut myself,&#8221; I stammered,
apologetically. For the first time in
my life I was afraid of a human being, from
pure terror of what he might see and think.</p>

<p>How I have suffered in the three weeks that
have passed since then! Day and night, moment
by moment, almost second by second, I
find myself listening for a footstep. Now I
fancy I hear it, and the icy sweat bursts from
every pore; now I realise that I only imagined
those stealthy, shuffling, hideously creeping
sounds coming along the floor toward me from
behind, and I give a gasp of relief.</p>

<p>What a mockery it all is! What a fool&#8217;s life
I have led! When I am not listening, I am
fiercely hating these people round me. They
are listening, too&mdash;listening eagerly&mdash;yes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
even my own children. I can see from their
furtive glances into my face that they, too,
have seen the droop in the line that was
straight, the growing weakness in the eye that
never quailed. It is frightful, this being gently
waited on and soothingly spoken to and
patiently borne with&mdash;as his gaolers treat a
man who is to be shot or hanged next sunrise.</p>

<p>Yet I dare not resent it. I can only cower
and suffer.</p>

<p>My crown is slipping from me. No, worse&mdash;it
is I that am slipping from it. It remains;
I, its master, must go. I&mdash;its master? How
it has tricked me! I have been its slave; it is
weary of me; it is about to cast me off.</p>

<p>It has been years since any one has said
&#8220;must&#8221; to me. I had forgotten what a hideous
word it is. And if one cannot resent it, cannot
resist it! All to whom I have said &#8220;must&#8221; are
revenged.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>Every night for a week I have cried like a
child. I put my handkerchief under my head
to prevent the tears from wilting my pillow
and revealing my secret to them as they keep
the death-watch on me. Last night I groaned
so loudly that my valet rushed in, turned on
the electric lights, and drew back the curtains
of my bed. When he saw me blazing at him
in fury, he shrank and stammered: &#8220;Oh, sir,
I thought&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out!&#8221; I shrieked.</p>

<p>I knew only too well what he thought.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the following day&mdash;or was it the second
day?&mdash;Gunderson Kuyper came to see me.
Deaths in my family and in his, and other matters,
chiefly&mdash;at least so I had imagined&mdash;my
unwillingness to have Helen go away for a
wedding trip, had delayed the marriage of my
daughter and his son. Then, too, there had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
been some attempt on the part of his lawyer
to find out my intentions in the matter of an
allowance for Helen. But, feeling that this
was a true love match which ought not to be
spoiled by any intrusion of the material and
the business-like, I had waved the lawyer off
with some vague politeness.</p>

<p>I was completely taken by surprise when,
with an exceedingly small amount of hemming
and hawing for so aristocratic a despiser
of commercialism as Gunderson Kuyper, he
flatly demanded a joint settlement of five millions
on his son and Helen!</p>

<p>It was particularly important that I should
not be excited. The doctors had warned me
that rage would probably be fatal. But in
spite of this I could not wholly conceal my
agitation. &#8220;You will have to excuse me, Mr.
Kuyper,&#8221; said I. &#8220;You see what a nervous
state I am in. Discussion about business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
would be highly dangerous. I can only assure
you that, as Helen is my favourite child, she
and, of course, her husband will be amply provided
for. I must beg you not to continue the
subject.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand. I am sincerely sorry.&#8221; The
oily scoundrel spoke in tones of the most delicate
sympathy. &#8220;We will postpone the marriage
until your health is such that you are
able to discuss it.&#8221; He rose and came toward
me to take leave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Instead of quieting my agitation, you
have aggravated it,&#8221; I said. &#8220;These young
people have their hearts set on each other&mdash;at
least I have been led to believe that your
son&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you are right, my dear Galloway,&#8221; he
said&mdash;he patronises me, drops the &#8220;Mr.&#8221; in
addressing me, and makes me feel too distant
with him to drop it in return. &#8220;But as my son<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
has less than fifteen thousand a year, he could
not think of marriage with a woman brought
up as your daughter has been&mdash;unless there
were assurance of some further income. I am
not in a position to make him an adequate
allowance&mdash;I can only double his present income.
He will, of course, inherit a considerable
fortune at my death. But I feel
it is only just that you should do your
share toward properly establishing the new
family.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall, I shall,&#8221; I said, feebly, trying to
make him see how unfit I was for such a discussion.
&#8220;Let them marry. Everything shall
be looked after. Only leave me in peace. Do
not disturb me with these mercenary&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>That word must have angered him, for his
face whitened, and he said, with suppressed
fury: &#8220;It is perfectly well known, Mr. Galloway,
that you made no provision whatever for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
your other children, and that you keep your
son on a beggarly allowance, considering your
fortune and the social station which you are
struggling to maintain. You have given your
elder daughter nothing. I speak plainly, sir,
because your dealings with your children and
with Mr. Bradish&#8217;s daughter are matters of
common gossip. I will permit no evasion, no
screening behind illness. I must speak the
only language you understand. It is a matter
of indifference to us&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had no idea the Kuypers were so&mdash;so
thrifty,&#8221; said I, myself in a fury at this vulgar
and insulting tirade.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I was saying,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;it is a matter
of indifference to us whether my son marries
your daughter or not. His mother and
I consented only after he had made it plain
to us that his happiness was involved. My
consent was conditioned on your acting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
the part of an honourable and considerate
father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our conceptions of a parent are evidently
as wide apart as our conceptions of the feeling
a young man should entertain toward a young
woman he purposes to marry,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Your
demand for five millions is preposterous. The
honour of marrying my daughter should be&mdash;shall
be&mdash;sufficient for your son&mdash;if I permit
the marriage to go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, sir. You may keep your
daughter and your ill-got millions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Strange that ill-got wealth should have
such a fascination for you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything is purified by passing to innocent
hands,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;But&mdash;enough! I
am ashamed that my temper should have degraded
me to such a controversy with such a
man. The longer we have had this matter
under advisement the more nauseating it has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
become. I might have known that nothing
but humiliation would result from even considering
an alliance with a family whose head is
notorious throughout the length and breadth
of this land for chicanery, for impudent dishonesty,
for theft&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>I heard no more. I was now dimly conscious
that his purpose throughout had been,
after a perfunctory attempt to arrange a settlement,
to provoke a quarrel that would make
the marriage impossible. At his last words I
felt a pain shoot from my brain throughout
my body&mdash;a pain so frightful that I straightway
lost consciousness.</p>

<p>At last my stealthy, shuffling, creeping enemy
had stolen up behind me and had struck
me down.</p>

<p>When I came to myself on the third day,
Helen was there. &#8220;Poor child!&#8221; I said, &#8220;your
dream is over, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>&#8220;No! No!&#8221; she protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;I know your heart was set on that
young fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything is all right now that you are
getting well,&#8221; she replied, and would not let
me say anything more.</p>

<p>In two weeks I was well enough to go about
again as before. I found that Delamotte had
defied his father and was only waiting for me
to consent. For Helen&#8217;s sake, I yielded.
Why blame the boy? Why make my child
wretched? Let them have the chance I never
had. Or, did I have it and throw it away?
No matter. To sacrifice them to revenge
would be petty.</p>

<p>Petty! What is not petty to me, seated in
front of The Great Fact?</p>

<p>I must rearrange my will properly to provide
for Helen.</p>

<p>How small and repulsive it all is to me!&mdash;all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
that has seemed so stupendous these forty
years. I am worn out. If I have not the
courage to die, still less have I the courage to
go on&mdash;or the interest. I want rest.</p>

<p>They tell me&mdash;what they always tell a man
in my straits. But they know better&mdash;and so
do I!</p>

<p>Nor do I care.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Too late! Too late! For now, not the
poorest, greediest pedlar that cheats in rags
for rags at the area-gate would change places
with me.</p>

<p>Oh, vanity, how you have swindled me!</p>

<p>No doubt they think my mind is stunned.
I have seen other men of my class stricken as
I am. I have watched them in this frightful
wait for the shaft they knew death had aimed
and would not long delay. I know now why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
their eyes were dull, why their ears seemed not
to hear. I know what they were thinking
about. For, hour after hour, I too&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">POSTSCRIPT</h2>
</div>


<p>On the second day after James Galloway&#8217;s
death, his eldest and outcast son called at the
Galloway palace and asked for his brother
Walter. Presently Walter, in dress and
manner an ideal chief mourner and chief
beneficiary, came down to him in the library.
The dead man lay in a magnificent casket in
the adjoining ball-room, which was half full
of funeral flowers. They were scenting the
whole house with stifling, suffocating perfume,
sweet yet sickening.</p>

<p>&#8220;You came to see&mdash;father?&#8221; said Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied James. &#8220;I do not wish to
be reminded. I am trying to forgive him.&#8221;
Then he looked into his brother&#8217;s eyes with the
keen, frank glance that is one of his many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
charms. &#8220;I&#8217;ve come to see you, to ask you
what you intend to do about the will.&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter&#8217;s eyes shifted. &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand
you,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean&mdash;do you intend to break it?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a long silence. Walter&#8217;s upper
lip, in spite of his efforts to control it, was
twitching nervously. At length he said: &#8220;He
is gone. It is his will. It contains his&mdash;life
ambition. I think it would be wrong not to
respect it.&#8221; He looked at his brother appealingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I must warn you that, unless you
break it and divide everything equally among
his heirs, I shall make a contest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you consented, Jim!&#8221; pleaded Walter,
recovering from his stupor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Consented&mdash;to what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To&mdash;to my staying&mdash;where I was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;While he lived. I said nothing about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
afterward. If you won&#8217;t break the will, I
shall. It will be easy enough. I can prove he
made it in the belief that I had forged his
name. I can prove&mdash;that&mdash;I didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you know, Jim, he heard the truth
years before he died.&#8221;</p>

<p>James smiled cynically. &#8220;<i>How</i> do I know
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you that mother told him on her
death-bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would any jury believe you, or believe
that I believed you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter flushed and looked indignantly at
his brother. &#8220;You offered to shield me
for what I did when I was a boy. I was
younger than you&mdash;hardly more than a child.
Now you want to punish me after making
me accept your offer. It ain&#8217;t like you,
Jim!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More like father, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221; said James,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
sadly. &#8220;But&mdash;I can&#8217;t do otherwise, Walt.
I&#8217;m only helping you to do what&#8217;s just&mdash;what&#8217;s
merely decent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are trying to destroy our father&#8217;s life-work!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;not his <i>life</i>-work. I can&#8217;t do that. I
wish I could. I wish I could destroy it even
in myself. No, all I can hope to do is to paralyse
his dead hand&mdash;that awful hand he has
plotted to keep on ruling and ruining with for
generations. And I <i>will</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You sha&#8217;n&#8217;t do it, Jim Galloway!&#8221; exclaimed
Walter, in a burst of fury. He stood
and waved his arms in a gesture as weak as it
was wild. &#8220;I won&#8217;t let you. I won&#8217;t be
cheated. I won&#8217;t! I <i>won&#8217;t</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s send for your wife and see what she
thinks,&#8221; said James.</p>

<p>Walter gasped and sank into his chair.
&#8220;No!&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;This is between you and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
me.&#8221; Then, with tears in his eyes, he added:
&#8220;You ought to be ashamed to take advantage
of me. And after letting me alone and letting
me get used to the idea! I didn&#8217;t think you
were mean and a coward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I admit I&#8217;m doing right in the wrong way&mdash;but
it&#8217;s the only way open to me. The will
must be broken.&#8221; James rose to go. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
let&#8217;s quarrel, Walter. You know what&#8217;s honest
and right; I&#8217;ve told you what I shall do.
Think it over. Talk it over with your wife.
Either keep your equal share, and devote the
rest to a memorial to mother&mdash;colleges, hospitals&mdash;anything&mdash;or
else divide all equally
among us four. Be sensible, Walt&mdash;think
what a hell his money and his ideas made for
himself and for the rest of us. If you get
only your equal share, you&#8217;ll have hard enough
work keeping from not being like&mdash;him. Be
sensible, Walt&mdash;and be decent!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>And he left the room and the house; and a
huge wave of that suffocating-sweet perfume
of funeral flowers poured out through the
opened street-door after him as if to overwhelm
him&mdash;like subtle hate on stealthy murder
bent.</p>

<p>That same afternoon the will was opened.
There were legacies of ten millions to Walter
and to Aurora, and of two millions to James&#8217;s
children. The rest of the estate, seventy millions,
was left unconditionally&mdash;to Helen.
The will was just one month old.</p>

<p>Walter was beaten in a long contest to have
it set aside, and have the estate equally divided
among the heirs. The lawyers got five millions.
When Helen was finally victorious, she
devoted all, except eight millions for James
and ten millions for Delamotte and herself, to
the magnificent endowment of her father&#8217;s
various public enterprises. The huge palace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
she made over into the &#8220;James Galloway Memorial
Museum of Art.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I only carried out his real will,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;for he was one of the noblest men that ever
lived&mdash;and nobody understood him but me.&#8221;</p>

veteran in the Little Corporal&#8217;s service&mdash;is
the dominant figure of the story. Quartered
on a distinguished family in the historic
town of Dantzig, he gives his life to the romance
of Desir&eacute;e, the daughter of the family, and Louis
d&#8217;Arragon, whose cousin she has married and
parted with at the church door. Louis&#8217;s search
with Barlasch for the missing Charles gives an
unforgettable picture of the terrible retreat from
Russia; and as a companion picture there is the
heroic defence of Dantzig by Rapp and his little
army of sick and starving. At the last Barlasch,
learning of the death of Charles, plans
and executes the escape of Desir&eacute;e from the
beleaguered town to join Louis.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="tall">I</span>N &#8220;The Reign of Queen Isyl&#8221; the authors
have hit upon a new scheme in fiction. The book
is both a novel and a collection of short stories.
The main story deals with a carnival of flowers
in a California city. Just before the coronation
the Queen of the Fiesta disappears, and her
Maid of Honor is crowned in her stead&mdash;Queen
Isyl. There are plots and counterplots&mdash;half-mockery,
half-earnest&mdash;beneath which the reader
is tantalized by glimpses of the genuine mystery
surrounding the real queen&#8217;s disappearance.</p>

<p>Thus far the story differs from other novels
only in the quaintly romantic atmosphere of modern
chivalry. Its distinctive feature lies in the
fact that in every chapter one of the characters
relates an anecdote. Each anecdote is a short
story of the liveliest and most amusing kind&mdash;complete
in itself&mdash;yet each bears a vital relation
to the main romance and its characters. The
short stories are as unusual and striking as the
novel of which they form a part.</p>

a ruffling young theologue new to the city; a
beautiful and innocent girl, suspected of witchcraft;
a crafty scholar and metaphysician seeking
to give over the city into the hands of the Savoyards;
a stern and powerful syndic whom the
scholar beguiles to betray his office by promises
of an elixir which shall save him from his fatal
illness; a brutal soldier of fortune; these are the
elements of which Weyman has composed the
most brilliant and thrilling of his romances.
Claude Mercier, the student, seeing the plot in
which the girl he loves is involved, yet helpless
to divulge it, finds at last his opportunity when
the treacherous men of Savoy are admitted within
Geneva&#8217;s walls, and in a night of whirlwind fighting
saves the city by his courage and address.
For fire and spirit there are few chapters in
modern literature such as those which picture the
splendid defence of Geneva, by the staid, churchly,
heroic burghers, fighting in their own blood under
the divided leadership of the fat Syndic, Baudichon,
and the bandy-legged sailor, Jehan Brosse,
winning the battle against the armed and armored
forces of the invaders.</p>

shallow and selfish man, who has very little appreciation

it turns out that he is even worse than this, however,
and that he has been married before to a
woman considerably below him, who, when he had
believed her dead, turns up and drives him from
England. The heroine, then a wife, yet not a

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
